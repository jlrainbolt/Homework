\prob{}{
	Apply the Noether procedure for constructing the energy-momentum tensor to the source-free electromagnetic field and show that the resulting tensor $\Tmn$ satisfies the conservation equation $\partsm \Tmn = 0$.
}

\prob{}{
	Show that the ``improvement'' of this tensor discussed in class, that leads to
	\eq{
		\Tmn = \frac{1}{4\pi} \paren{ \Fml \Fsln + \frac{1}{4} \etamn \Fsab \Fab },
	}
	does not spoil conservation.
}

\prob{}{
	Evaluate $\Too$ and $\Toi$ in terms of electric and magnetic fields.  What is the physical interpretation of these quantities?
}

\prob{}{
	Calculate the correction to the conservation quantity $\partsm\Tmn = 0$ in the presence of a nonzero current~$\Jm$.
