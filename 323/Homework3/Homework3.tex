\sol{
	The boost described in Section~{12.3} of Jackson is into a frame $K'$, which moves with velocity $\vuu$ with respect to the laboratory frame, where
	\eq{
		\vuu = c \frac{\vE \cross \vB}{\vB^2}
	}
	is the particle's drift velocity.  In $K'$, the fields are given by
	\al{
		\vEpar' &= \vEperp' = \vBpar' = 0, &
		\vBperp' &= \frac{\absvB}{\gam}
		= \sqrt{\frac{\vB^2 - \vE^2}{\vB^2}} \absvB,
	}
	where $\vEpar'$ and $\vBpar'$ are parallel to $\vuu$, and $\vEperp'$ and $\vBperp'$ are perpendicular to $\vuu$.  This means that the particle's motion in this frame is the same as motion in a uniform, static magnetic field.  The particle's trajectory in this kind of field when $\vB$ points in the $z$ direction is given by Jackson~(12.41),
	\eq{
		\vr(t) = \vro + \vpar t \,\zh + i a (\xh - i \,\yh) e^{i \omgB t}
	}
	
	% According to Jackson~(11.17),
%	\eq{
%		\gam = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \bet^2}}
%		= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \vuu^2 / c^2}}.
%	}
%	Using both expressions for $\vBperp'$, we can solve for $\vuu$:
%	\eq{
%		\frac{1}{\gam} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\vuu^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\vB^2 - \vE^2}{\vB^2}}
%		\qimplies
%		\frac{\vuu^2}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{\vE^2 - \vB^2}{\vB^2}
%		\qimplies
%		\absvu = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vE^2 - \vB^2}{\vB^2}}.
