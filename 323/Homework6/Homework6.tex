\prob{}{
	Show that for arbitrary initial polarization, the scattering cross section of a perfectly conducting sphere of radius $a$, summed over outgoing polarizations, is given in the long-wavelength limit by
	\eq{
		\dv{\sig}{\Omg}(\vepso, \nho, \nh) = k^4 a^6 \brac{ \frac{5}{4} - \abs{\vepso \vdot \nh}^2 - \frac{1}{4} \abs{\nh \vdot (\nho \cross \vepso)}^2 - \nho \vdot \nh },
	}
	where $\nho$ and $\nh$ are the directions of the incident and scattered radiations, respectively, while $\vepso$ is the (perhaps complex) unit polarization vector of the incident radiation ($\vepso^* \vdot \vepso = 1$; $\nho \vdot \vepso = 0$).
}

\prob{}{
	If the incident radiation is linearly polarized, show that the cross section is
	\eq{
		\dv{\sig}{\Omg}(\vepso, \nho, \nh) = k^4 a^6 \brac{ \frac{5}{8} (1 + \cos^2\tht) - \cos\tht - \frac{3}{8} \sin^2\tht \cos(2\phi) },
	}
	where $\nh \vdot \nho = \cos\tht$ and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured from the direction of linear polarization.
}

\prob{}{
	What is the ratio of scattered intensities at $\tht = \pi / 2$, $\phi = 0$ and $\tht = \pi / 2$, $\phi = \pi / 2$?  Explain physically in terms of the induced multipoles and their radiation patterns.

\state{(Jackson 12.15)}{
	Consider the Proca equation for a localized steady-state distribution of current that has only a static magnetic moment.  This model can be used to study the observable effects of a finite photon mass on the earth's magnetic field.  Note that if the magnetization is $\vcM(\vx)$ the current density can be written as $\vJ = c (\grad \cross \vcM)$.

	Show that if $\vcM = \vm f(\vx)$, where $\vm$ is a fixed vector and $f(\vx)$ is a localized scalar function, the vector potential is
	\eq{
		\vA(\vx) = -\vm \cross \grad \int f(\vx') \frac{e^{-\mu \abs{\vx - \vx'}}}{\abs{\vx - \vx'}} \ddcxp.

	If the magnetic dipole is a point dipole at the origin [$f(\vx) = \del(\vx)$], show that the magnetic field away from the origin is
	\eq{
		\vB(\vx) = [ 3 \,\rh (\rh \vdot \vm) - \vm ] \paren{ 1 + \mu r + \frac{\mu^2 r^2}{3} }\frac{e^{-\mu r}}{r^3} - \frac{2}{3} \mu^2 \vm \frac{e^{-\mu r}}{r}.

\prob{}{
	The result of Prob.~{3(b)} shows that at fixed $r = R$ (on the surface of the earth), the earth's magnetic field will appear as a dipole angular distribution, plus an added constant magnetic field (an apparently external field) antiparallel to $\vm$.  Satellite and surface observations lead to the conclusion that the ``external'' field is less than $\num{4e-3}$ times the dipole field at the magnetic equator.  Estimate a lower limit on $\mu^{-1}$ in earth radii and an upper limit on the photon mass in grams from this datum.
