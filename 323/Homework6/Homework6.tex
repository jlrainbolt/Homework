	Consider the Proca equation for a localized steady-state distribution of current that has only a static magnetic moment.  This model can be used to study the observable effects of a finite photon mass on the earth's magnetic field.  Note that if the magnetization is $\vcM(\vx)$ the current density can be written as $\vJ = c \,(\grad \cross \vcM)$.

	Show that if $\vcM = \vm \,f(\vx)$, where $\vm$ is a fixed vector and $f(\vx)$ is a localized scalar function, the vector potential is
	\eq{

	The Proca equations of motion in the static limit are given by the equation immediately following Jackson~(12.93),
	\eq{
		\lap \Asa - \mu^2 \Asa = -\frac{4\pi}{c} \Jsa,

	\eqn{thing3}{	
		\lap \vA - \mu^2 \vA = -\frac{4\pi}{c} \vJ.

\prob{}{
	The result of Prob.~{3(b)} shows that at fixed $r = R$ (on the surface of the earth), the earth's magnetic field will appear as a dipole angular distribution, plus an added constant magnetic field (an apparently external field) antiparallel to $\vm$.  Satellite and surface observations lead to the conclusion that the ``external'' field is less than $\num{4e-3}$ times the dipole field at the magnetic equator.  Estimate a lower limit on $\mu^{-1}$ in earth radii and an upper limit on the photon mass in grams from this datum.
