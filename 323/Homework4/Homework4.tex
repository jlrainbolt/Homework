\state{(Jackson 14.3)}{
	The Heaviside-Feynman expression for the electric field of a particle of charge $e$ in arbitrary motion, an alternative to the {\Lienard}-Wiechert expression~(14.14) is
	\eq{
		\vE = e \brac{ \frac{\nh}{R^2} }\ret + e \brac{ \frac{R}{c} }\ret \dv{t} \brac{ \frac{\nh}{R^2} }\ret + \frac{e^2}{c^2} \dv[2]{t} [ \nh ]\ret,
	}
	where the time derivatives are with respect to the time at the observation point.  The magnetic fields are given by (14.3).
	
	Using the fact that the retarded time is $t' = t - R(t') / c$ and that, as a result,
	\eq{
		\dv{t}{t'} = 1 - \vbet(t') \vdot \nh(t'),
	}
	show that the form above yields (14.14) when the time differentiations are performed.

	Using the {\Lienard}-Wiechart fields, discuss the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle in nonrelativistic motion of a particle with charge $e$.  Sketch the angular distribution of the radiation and determine the total power radiated in each case.

\prob{}{
	The particle is moving along the $z$ axis with instantaneous position $z(t) = \alp \cos \omgo t$.

\prob{}{
	The particle is moving in a circle of radius $R$ in the $xy$ plane with constant angular frequency $\omgo$.
