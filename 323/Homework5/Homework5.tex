\state{(Jackson 9.2)}{
	A radiating quadrupole consists of a square of side $a$ with charges $\pm q$ at alternate corners.  The square rotates with angular velocity $\omg$ about an axis normal to the place of the square and through its center.  Calculate the quadrupole moments, the radiation fields, the angular distribution of radiation, and the total radiated power, all in the long-wavelength approximation.  What is the frequency of the radiation?

\state{(Jackson 9.4)}{
	Apply the approach of Prob.~{1(b)} to the current and magnetization densities of the particle of charge $q$ rotating about the origin in the $xy$ plane in a circle of radius $R$ at constant angular speed $\omgo$.  The motion is such that $\omgo R \ll c$.

\prob{}{
	Find $\Jxn$, $\Jyn$, and $\Jzn$ in terms of cylindrical coordinates for all $n$.  Also determine the components of the orbital ``magnetization,'' $(\vx \cross \vJn) / 2$, and its divergence (which plays the role of a magnetic charge density for magnetic multipoles, as in $\Mlm$ (9.172)).

\prob{}{
	What long-wavelength magnetic multipoles $(l, m)$ occur and at what frequencies?  (Remember that the multipole order $l$ does not necessarily equal the harmonic number $n$.)

\prob{}{
	Use linear superposition to generalize your argument to the four charges rotating in Prob.~{2} at radius $R = a / \sqrt{2}$.  What harmonics occur, and what magnetic multipoles at each harmonic?  Is there a magnetic multipole contribution at the $E2$ frequency of Prob.~{2}?  Is it significant relative to the $E2$ radiation?
