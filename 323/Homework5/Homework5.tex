\state{(Jackson 9.1)}{
	A common textbook example of a radiating system is a configuration of charges fixed relative to each other but in rotation.  The charge density is obviously a function of time, but it is \emph{not} of the form
	\aln{ \label{rhoJ}
		\rho(\vx, t) &= \rho(\vx) \,e^{-i \omg t}, &
		\vJ(\vx, t) &= \vJ(\vx) \,e^{-i \omg t}.
	}

\prob{}{
	Show that for rotating charges one alternative is to calculate \emph{real} time-dependent multipole moments using $\rho(\vx, t)$ directly and then compute the multipole moments for a given harmonic frequency with the convention of Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ} by inspection or Fourier decomposition of the time-dependent moments.  Note that care must be taken when calculating $\qlm(t)$ to form linear combinations that are real before making the connection.
}

\sol{
	The multipole moments are given by Wald~(2.80),
	\eqn{qlm}{
		\qlm = \int \rho(\vx') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp,
	}
	where the spherical harmonics $\Ylm$ are given by Wald~(2.58),
	\eqn{Ylm}{
		\Ylm(\tht, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{2l + 1}{4\pi} \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}} \Pl(\cos\tht) \,e^{i m \phi},
	}
	and $\Pl$ are the Legendre polynomials.
	
	We will choose coordinates for a frame $K$ such that the charge distribution rotates counterclockwise about the $z$ axis with angular velocity $\omg$.  Note that a point charge orbiting counterclockwise about $z$ axis has the position vector
	\eq{
		\vx(t) = R \,\rh + \thto \,\thh + (\omg t + \phio) \,\phh,
	}
	where $R$ is its distance from the origin, $\thto$ its inclination, and $\phio$ its $\phi$ coordinate at $t = 0$.  This means that, if we take a stationary charge distribution $\rho(\vx)$ and set it rotating in this way, we are making the change of variable $\phi \to \phi + \omg t$.  Hence $\rho(\vx, t) = \rho(r, \tht, \phi + \omg t)$.
	
	Making this substitution into Eq.~\refeq{qlm}, we obtain the time-dependent multipole moments
	\eq{
		\qlm(t) = \int \rho(\vx', t) \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp
		= \int \rho(r', \tht', \phi' + \omg t) \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp.
	}
	Now we will transform to a rotating coordinate frame $\Kt$ with $(\rt, \thtt, \phit) = (r, \tht, \phi + \omg t)$.  In this frame, $\rho(\vx, t)$ is stationary and the time dependence is in $\Ylm$, so
	\eq{
		\qtlm(t) = \int \rho(\rt', \thtt', \phit') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\thtt', \phit' - \omg t) \dcxp.
	}
	From Eq.~\refeq{Ylm},
	\eq{
		\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi - \omg t) = \sqrt{\frac{2l + 1}{4\pi} \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}} \Pl(\cos\tht) \,e^{-i m (\phi - \omg t)}
		= e^{i m \omg t} \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi),
	}
	so we have
	\eq{
		\qtlm(t) = e^{i m \omg t} \int \rho(\rt', \thtt', \phit') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\thtt', \phit') \dcxp
		= e^{i m \omg t} \,\qtlm.
	}
	
	Since the charge distribution is stationary in $\Kt$, $\qtlm(t) = \qlm$ and $\qlm(t) = \qtlm$.  Switching back to $K$, then, gives us
	\eq{
		\qlm(t) = \qlm \,e^{-i m \omg t},
	}
	which has the convention of Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ}.  Here, however, we have multiple frequencies $m \omg$, where $m \in [-l, l]$ for integer $m$.
	
	To form real linear combinations, we note that $\qlm \Ylm$ is real since the scalar potential defined by Wald~(2.79),
	\eq{
		\Phi(\vx) = \sum_{l, m} \frac{4\pi}{2l + 1} \frac{\qlm}{r^{l + 1}} \Ylm(\tht, \phi),
	}
	is a linear combination of $\qlm \Ylm$ and is real.  According to Jackson~(3.54) and (4.7), $\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = (-1)^m \Ylm^*(\tht, \phi)$ and $\qlnm = (-1)^m \qlm^*$.  So
	\eq{
		\qlnm(t) \,\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = (-1)^{2m} \qlm^*(t) \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi)
		= \qlm^*(t) \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi).
	}
	Let $\qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) = a + i b$, so $\Re[ \qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) ] = a$ and $\Im[ \qlm \Ylm ] = b$.  Then
	\eq{
		\qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) + \qlnm(t) \,\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = a + i b + a - i b
		= 2a
		= 2 \Re[ \qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) ].
	}
	
	Finally, let $\qhlm$ be the multipole moment corresponding to the harmonic frequency $m \omg$, where $m \in [0, l]$.  These multipole moments are given by
	\ans{ \eq{
		\qhlm = \begin{cases}
			2 \qlm & m > 0, \\
			\qlm & m = 0,
		\end{cases}
	} }%
	where $\qlm$ is defined by Eq.~\refeq{qlm}.

\prob{}{
	Consider a charge density $\rho(\vx, t)$ that is periodic in time with period $T = 2\pi / \omg$.  By making a Fourier \emph{series} expansion, show that it can be written as
	\eq{
		\rho(\vx, t) = \rhoo(x) + \sumni \Re[ 2\rhon(\vx) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} ],
	}
	where
	\eq{
		\rhon(\vx) = \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t} \ddt.
	}
	This shows explicitly how to establish connection with Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ}.

	For a single charge $q$ rotating about the origin in the $xy$ place in a circle of radius $R$ at constant angular speed $\omgo$, calculate the $l = 0$ and $l = 1$ multipole moments by the methods of Probs.~{1(a)} and {1(b)} and compare.

The square rotates with angular velocity $\omg$ about an axis normal to the place of the square and through its center.
