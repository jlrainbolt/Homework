\state{(Jackson 9.4)}{
	Apply the approach of Prob.~{1(b)} to the current and magnetization densities of the particle of charge $q$ rotating about the origin in the $xy$ plane in a circle of radius $R$ at constant angular speed $\omgo$.  The motion is such that $\omgo R \ll c$.

\prob{}{
	Find $\Jxn$, $\Jyn$, and $\Jzn$ in terms of cylindrical coordinates for all $n$.  Also determine the components of the orbital ``magnetization,'' $(\vx \cross \vJn) / 2$, and its divergence. %(which plays the role of a magnetic charge density for magnetic multipoles, as in $\Mlm$ (9.172)).
}

\sol{
	The charge distribution is given by Eq.~\refeq{rhopt}.

\prob{}{
	What long-wavelength magnetic multipoles $(l, m)$ occur and at what frequencies?  (Remember that the multipole order $l$ does not necessarily equal the harmonic number $n$.)

\prob{}{
	Use linear superposition to generalize your argument to the four charges rotating in Prob.~{2} at radius $R = a / \sqrt{2}$.  What harmonics occur, and what magnetic multipoles at each harmonic?  Is there a magnetic multipole contribution at the $E2$ frequency of Prob.~{2}?  Is it significant relative to the $E2$ radiation?
