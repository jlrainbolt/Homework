	A common textbook example of a radiating system is a configuration of charges fixed relative to each other but in rotation.  The charge density is obviously a function of time, but it is \emph{not} of the form
	\aln{ \label{rhoJ}
		\rho(\vx, t) &= \rho(\vx) \,e^{-i \omg t}, &
		\vJ(\vx, t) &= \vJ(\vx) \,e^{-i \omg t}.

	Show that for rotating charges one alternative is to calculate \emph{real} time-dependent multipole moments using $\rho(\vx, t)$ directly and then compute the multipole moments for a given harmonic frequency with the convention of Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ} by inspection or Fourier decomposition of the time-dependent moments.  Note that care must be taken when calculating $\qlm(t)$ to form linear combinations that are real before making the connection.
}

\sol{
	The multipole moments are given by Wald~(2.80),
	\eqn{qlm}{
		\qlm = \int \rho(\vx') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp,
	}
	where the spherical harmonics $\Ylm$ are given by Wald~(2.58),
	\eqn{Ylm}{
		\Ylm(\tht, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{2l + 1}{4\pi} \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}} \Pl(\cos\tht) \,e^{i m \phi},
	}
	and $\Pl$ are the Legendre polynomials.
	
	We will choose coordinates for a frame $K$ such that the charge distribution rotates counterclockwise about the $z$ axis with angular velocity $\omg$.  Note that a point charge orbiting counterclockwise about $z$ axis in the $xy$ plane has the position vector
	\eqn{ptch}{
		\vx(t) = R \cos(\omg t) \,\xh + R \sin(\omg t) \,\yh
		= R \,\rh + \omg t \,\phh,
	}
	where $R$ is its distance from the origin.  This means that, if we take a stationary charge distribution $\rho(\vx)$ and set it rotating in this way, we are making the change of variable $\phi \to \phi + \omg t$.  Hence $\rho(\vx, t) = \rho(r, \tht, \phi + \omg t)$.
	
	Making this substitution into Eq.~\refeq{qlm}, we obtain the time-dependent multipole moments
	\eq{
		\qlm(t) = \int \rho(\vx', t) \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp
		= \int \rho(r', \tht', \phi' + \omg t) \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\tht', \phi') \dcxp.
	}
	To find something that resembles Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ}, we transform to a rotating coordinate frame $\Kt$ with $(\rt, \thtt, \phit) = (r, \tht, \phi + \omg t)$.  In this frame, $\rho(\vx, t)$ is stationary and the time dependence is in $\Ylm$.  Then the complex moments are
	\eq{
		\qtlm(t) = \int \rho(\rt', \thtt', \phit') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\thtt', \phit' - \omg t) \dcxp.
	}
	From Eq.~\refeq{Ylm},
	\eq{
		\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi - \omg t) = \sqrt{\frac{2l + 1}{4\pi} \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}} \Pl(\cos\tht) \,e^{-i m (\phi - \omg t)}
		= e^{i m \omg t} \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi),
	}
	so we have
	\eq{
		\qtlm(t) = e^{i m \omg t} \int \rho(\rt', \thtt', \phit') \,{r'}^l \,\Ylm^*(\thtt', \phit') \dcxp
		= e^{i m \omg t} \,\qtlm.
	}
	Since the charge distribution is stationary in $\Kt$, $\qtlm(t) = \qlm$ and $\qlm(t) = \qtlm$.  Switching back to $K$, then, gives us
	\eq{
		\qlm(t) = \qlm \,e^{-i m \omg t},
	}
	which has the convention of Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ}.  Here, however, we have multiple frequencies $m \omg$, where $m \in [-l, l]$ for integer $m$.  However, a frequency $m\omg$ is unphysical for $m < 0$.
	
	To form real linear combinations, we note that $\qlm \Ylm$ is real since the scalar potential defined by Wald~(2.79),
	\eq{
		\Phi(\vx) = \sum_{l, m} \frac{4\pi}{2l + 1} \frac{\qlm}{r^{l + 1}} \Ylm(\tht, \phi),
	}
	is a linear combination of $\qlm \Ylm$ and is real.  According to Jackson~(3.54) and (4.7), $\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = (-1)^m \Ylm^*(\tht, \phi)$ and $\qlnm = (-1)^m \qlm^*$.  So
	\eq{
		\qlnm(t) \,\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = (-1)^{2m} \qlm^*(t) \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi)
		= \qlm^*(t) \,\Ylm^*(\tht, \phi).
	}
	Let $\qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) = a + i b$, so $\Re[ \qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) ] = a$ and $\Im[ \qlm \Ylm ] = b$.  Then
	\eqn{realpart}{
		\qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) + \qlnm(t) \,\Ylnm(\tht, \phi) = a + i b + a - i b
		= 2a
		= 2 \Re[ \qlm(t) \,\Ylm(\tht, \phi) ].
	}
	This expression gives the real time-dependent multipole moments, which let us avoid negative frequencies.
	
	Finally, let $\qhlm$ be the multipole moment corresponding to the harmonic frequency $m \omg$.  These multipole moments are given by
	\eqn{qhlm}{
		\ans{ \qhlm = \begin{cases}
			2 \Re[\qlm] & m > 0, \\
			\qlm & m = 0, \\
			0 & m < 0,
		\end{cases} }
	}
	where $\qlm$ is defined by Eq.~\refeq{qlm} with $\rho(\vx) \to \rho(\vx, t = 0)$.

\prob{}{
	Consider a charge density $\rho(\vx, t)$ that is periodic in time with period $T = 2\pi / \omg$.  By making a Fourier \emph{series} expansion, show that it can be written as
	\eq{
		\rho(\vx, t) = \rhoo(x) + \sumni \Re[ 2\rhon(\vx) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} ],
	}
	where
	\eq{
		\rhon(\vx) = \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t} \ddt.
	}
	This shows explicitly how to establish connection with Eq.~\refeq{rhoJ}.
}

\sol{
	The Fourier series is, according to Jackson~(2.36--37),
	\eq{
		f(x) = \frac{\Ao}{2} + \summi \brac{ \Am \cos(\frac{2\pi m x}{a}) + \Bm \sin(\frac{2\pi m x}{a}) }
	}
	where the interval in $x$ is $(-a/2, a/2)$, and
	\al{
		\Am &= \frac{2}{a} \int_{-a / 2}^{a / 2} f(x) \cos(\frac{2\pi m x}{a}) \ddx, &
		\Bm &= \frac{2}{a} \int_{-a / 2}^{a / 2} f(x) \sin(\frac{2\pi m x}{a}) \ddx.
	}
	
	Making the variables changes $x \to t$, $a \to T$, and $m \to n$, we have
	\aln{
		\rho(\vx, t) &%= \frac{\Ao}{2} + \sumni \brac{ \An \cos(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}) + \Bn \sin(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}) }
		= \frac{\Ao}{2} + \summi [ \An \cos(n \omgo t) + \Bn \sin(n \omgo t) ]
		= \frac{\Ao}{2} + \sumni \paren{ \An \frac{e^{i n \omgo t} + e^{-i n \omgo t}}{2} + \Bn \frac{e^{i n \omgo t} - e^{-i n \omgo t}}{2 i} } \notag \\
		&= \frac{\Ao}{2} + \sumni \paren{ \frac{\An - i \Bn}{2} e^{i n \omgo t} + \frac{\An + i \Bn}{2} e^{-i n \omgo t} }. \label{series}
	}
	
	For the coefficients, since the integrands are $T$-periodic, we can freely shift the bounds of integration.  Doing so,
	\al{
		\Ao &= \frac{2}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \ddt, &
		\An &= \frac{2}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \cos(n \omgo t) \ddt, &
		\Bn &= \frac{2}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \sin(n \omgo t) \ddt.
	}
	Then the ``new'' coefficients are
	\al{
		\frac{\An - i \Bn}{2} &= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) [ \cos(n \omgo t) - i \sin(n \omgo t) ] \ddt
		= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} \ddt
		\equiv \rhonn(\vx, t), \\
		\frac{\Ao}{2} &= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \ddt
		\equiv \rhoo(\vx, t), \\
		\frac{\An + i \Bn}{2} &= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) [ \cos(n \omgo t) + i \sin(n \omgo t) ] \ddt
		= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t} \ddt
		\equiv \rhon(\vx, t),
	}
	where we have identified each with $\rhon(\vx, t)$.  We note that $\rhonn(\vx, t) = \rhon^*(\vx, t)$, and that $\rhon(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t}$ is real.  Then, similarly to Eq.~\refeq{realpart},
	\eq{
		\rhon(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t} + \rhonn(\vx, t) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} = 2 \Re[ \rhon(\vx, t) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} ].
	}
	Making these substitutions in Eq.~\refeq{series}, we have
	\ans{ \al{
		\rho(\vx, t) &= \rhoo(\vx, t) + \sumni \Re[ 2\rhon(\vx) \,e^{-i n \omgo t} ], &
		\text{where} \quad
		\rhon(\vx) &= \frac{1}{T} \intoT \rho(\vx, t) \,e^{i n \omgo t} \ddt,
	} }%
	as desired. \qed
