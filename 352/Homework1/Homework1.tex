\state{Quantum diatomic ideal gas}{
	An ideal diatomic gas consists of non-interacting identical molecules $H = \sumiN \hi$ which have three independent degrees of freedom $h = \hK + \hV + \hR$. The first one is the kinetic energy of translational motion $\hK = \vp^2 / 2m$. The second is vibrational, i.e.~each molecule is an oscillator with $\hV = \pi^2/2 + \omg^2 q^2 / 2$. The third is rotational $\hR = \vL^2 / 2 I$, where $\vL$ is the angular momentum.  These three d.o.f.~can be treated independently.  Treat them as independent
subsystems.

	Now consider all systems as quantum and repeat the calculations.  This means that the momentum $\vp$ is quantized, each component of momentum taking the values $\pk = (2 \pi \hbar / L) k$, where $k$ is an arbitrary integer and $L$ is the linear size of the box.  Similarly, the
energy of the vibrational modes is quantized as $\En = \hbar \omg (n + 1 / 2)$, and the square of the angular momentum as $L^2 = \hbar^2 l (l + 1)$, where $l$ is a non-negative integer.  Discuss the quantum (low temperature) and the classical (high temperature) limits.
