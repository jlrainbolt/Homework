\state{Non-equilibrium entropies of Fermi, Bose, and Boltzmann distributions}{
	Consider a gas out of equilibrium with a slightly non-uniform density in $n(x)$ and mean density $\nb = V^{-1} \int n(x) \ddcx$.  We know that if the gas obeys Boltzmann statistics, its entropy is $S = -\int n \log n \ddV$.
}

%
%	1.1
%

\prob{}{
	Argue that this formula is valid only if the gradients are small: $\abs{\gradx n} \ll \nb^{4/3}$ (``coarse-graining condition'') and that $\abs{n(x) - \nb} \ll \nb$.
}

%
%	1.2
%

\prob{}{
	Remove the second condition in {1.1} and obtain the general formula for the entropy for both Fermi and Bose gases.
}



\state{Quantum correction to the Boltzmann thermodynamics}{
	Find the the quantum correction to the free energy of the Boltzmann gas (the leading $\hbar$-dependent term in the expansion of the free energy at small $\hbar$) for Bose and Fermi gases.  From there, find the correction to the pressure.  Does the quantum correction increase or decrease the pressure (and why is the answer predictable)?
