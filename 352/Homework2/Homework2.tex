\state{Boltzmann \texorpdfstring{$H$}{H}-function}{
	The equilibrium distribution function $f(p, q)$ of a non-interacting gas is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  Show that the entropy of such a system satisfies $S = -\kB H + \const$, where $H = \int f \ln f \dG$ is the Boltzmann $H$-function.
}


\clearpage
\state{BBGKY}{
	Consider for simplicity a 1D system (a system on a circle) of $N$ particles with an arbitrary two-body interaction:
	\eq{
		H = \sumiN \frac{\pii^2}{2m} + \sumi U(\xii) + \sumij V(\xii - \xjj).
	}
	Give a derivation of the first equation of the BBGKY hierarchy at equilibrium for this system, which is a relation between the 1-point and 2-point distribution (correlation) functions.
}


\state{Partition function as a generating functional}{
	Consider the Gibbs distribution of the system described in Problem~5.  For simplicity neglect the kinetic energy. Let $n(x) = \sumi \del(x - \xii)$ be the density, and $\evnx$ its expectation value. Let $C(x, y) = \ev{\del n(x) \,\del n(y)}$, where $\del n(x) = n(x) - \evn$, be the two-point correlation function.
}

\prob{}{
	Show that $\evnx = -T \,\deldvs{\ln Z}{U(x)}$, where $Z[U(x)]$ is the partition function of the Gibbs distribution treated as a functional of the potential $U$.
}

\prob{}{
	Show that
	\eq{
		C(x, y) = T^2 \deldvm{\ln Z}{U(x)}{U(y)}
		= -T \deldv{\evnx}{U(y)}
		= -T \deldv{\evny}{U(x)}.
