\state{Collision frequency and pressure}{
	Consider an ideal relativistic gas in a container.  Given the rate of the collisions of molecules with the wall of the container per unit area per unit time, find the pressure of the gas in the relativistic, non-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic cases, and compare the results.
}

%\sol{
%	In order to find an expression for the number of collisions of molecules with the wall of the container per unit area per unit time, we need to find the statistical distribution in velocity space.  This is very similar to how we found the momentum distribution in Prob.~{1.1}.
%	
%	Note that
%	\eq{
%		\vp^2 = (\gam m \vv)^2
%	}
%	
%	The energy of a relativistic molecule is
%	\eq{
%		\eps = c \sqrt{m^2 c^2 + \frac{m^2 \vv^2}{1 - \vv^2 / c^2}}
%		= m c^3 \sqrt{\frac{1}{c^2 - \vv^2}}
%	}
%	where $\vv$ is its velocity.  Assuming a three-dimensional gas,
%	\eq{
%		\ddNvv = \frac{a}{(2\pi\hbar)^2} \exp(-\frac{m c^3}{T} \sqrt{\frac{1}{c^2 - \vv^2}}) \dcv.
%	}
%	We find $a$ by integrating over all of velocity space and normalizing to $N/V$:
%	\eq{
%		\frac{N}{V} = \int \ddNvv
%		= \frac{4\pi a}{(2\pi\hbar)^2} \intoi v^2 \exp(-\frac{m c^3}{T} \sqrt{\frac{1}{c^2 - v^2}}) \ddv

\state{Boltzmann \texorpdfstring{$H$}{H}-function}{
	The equilibrium distribution function $f(p, q)$ of a non-interacting gas is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  Show that the entropy of such a system satisfies $S = -\kB H + \const$, where $H = \int f \ln f \dG$ is the Boltzmann $H$-function.
}



\state{BBGKY}{
	Consider for simplicity a 1D system (a system on a circle) of $N$ particles with an arbitrary two-body interaction:
	\eq{
		H = \sumiN \frac{\pii^2}{2m} + \sumi U(\xii) + \sumij V(\xii - \xjj).
	}
	Give a derivation of the first equation of the BBGKY hierarchy at equilibrium for this system, which is a relation between the 1-point and 2-point distribution (correlation) functions.
}


\state{Partition function as a generating functional}{
	Consider the Gibbs distribution of the system described in Problem~5.  For simplicity neglect the kinetic energy. Let $n(x) = \sumi \del(x - \xii)$ be the density, and $\evnx$ its expectation value. Let $C(x, y) = \ev{\del n(x) \,\del n(y)}$, where $\del n(x) = n(x) - \evn$, be the two-point correlation function.
}

\prob{}{
	Show that $\evnx = -T \,\deldvs{\ln Z}{U(x)}$, where $Z[U(x)]$ is the partition function of the Gibbs distribution treated as a functional of the potential $U$.
}

\prob{}{
	Show that
	\eq{
		C(x, y) = T^2 \deldvm{\ln Z}{U(x)}{U(y)}
		= -T \deldv{\evnx}{U(y)}
		= -T \deldv{\evny}{U(x)}.
