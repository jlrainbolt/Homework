\state{Pauli paramagnetism}{
	Cold atomic gases could be realized by atomic isotopes which are fermions ($^6$Li, $^{40}$K, etc.).  Such isotopes may have a large atomic spin.  Assuming that the Fermi gas is degenerate and its constituents have a spin $s> 1 / 2$, compute the Pauli magnetic susceptibility.
}

\sol{
	According to p.~2 of Lecture 12, the magnetic susceptibility is defined
	\eq{
		\chi = \frac{1}{V} \pdv{N}{\mu},
	}
	where $N = \pdv*{\Omg}{\mu}$, and
	\eq{
		\Omg(\mu, B) = \frac{1}{2} \Omgo(\mu + B) + \frac{1}{2} \Omgo(\mu - B)
		\approx \Omgo(\mu) + \frac{B^2}{2} \pdv[2]{\Omgo}{\mu},
	}
	where $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field and $\Omgo$ is the thermodynamic potential with no field present.  \hl{but I think this doesn't work because it is only for spin 1/2}
	
	For a Fermi gas, the thermodynamic potential is~\cite[p.~145]{Landau}
	\eq{
		\Omgo = -T \sumk \ln(1 + e^{(\mu - \epsk) / T}).
	}
	Note that
	\al{
		\pdv{\Omgo}{\mu} &= 
	}
	Then the thermodynamic potential in the magnetic field is
	\eq{
		\Omg = 
	}

\prob{(*)}{
	Compute the Landau diamagnetic susceptibility for a Fermi gas confined to a box whose linear size in the $z$ direction is $\Lz \ll \Lx, \Ly$.  The magnetic field is directed along the $z$ direction.  Consider two cases when the energy spacing $(2\pi \hbar / \Lz)^2 / 2m$ is much larger/smaller than the cyclotron energy $\muB B$.
