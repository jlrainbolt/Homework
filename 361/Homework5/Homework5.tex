\state{Colossal magnetoresistance}{
	In a material like that shown in Fig.~6.10 the magnetism arises from a mechanism called double exchange, which is a version of itinerant exchange but involving two types of $d$ bands.  The prototype compound is $\LaSrMnO$, where the valence of La is $3+$ and Sr is $2+$.  This is a cubic (perovskite) crystal structure where the $\Mn$ ions are nominally equidistant from six oxygen neighbors in three Cartesian directions.
}

\prob{
	Explain why the valence of $\Mn$ in the compound $\LaSrMnO$ is expected to be between $3+$ and $4+$ and that the occupancy of the $d$ levels is expected to be $4 - x$ electrons per $\Mn$ ion.
}

\sol{
	The relevant electron configurations are~\cite{La, Sr, Mn, O}
	\al{
		\La &: 5 d^1 \ 6 s^2, &
		\Sr &: 5 s^2, &
		\Ox &: 2 s^2 \ 2 p^4, &
		\Mn &: 3 d^5 \ 4 s^2.
	}
	The atoms (excluding $\Mn$) have valence
	\al{
		\La &: {3+}, &
		\Sr &: {2+}, &
		\Ox &: {2-}.
	}
	This is because $\La$ and $\Sr$ have few valence electrons and will tend to donate them, while $\Ox$ will fill its $2p$ shell upon receiving two more electrons.
	
	The two extremes are $\LaMnO$~($x = 0$) and $\SrMnO$~($x = 1$).  For $\LaMnO$, $\Oe$ has valence $6-$ and $\La$ $3+$, so $\Mn$ must have valence $3+$ to form a neutral compound.  For $\LaMnO$, $\Oe$ again has valence $6-$ but $\Sr$ has valence $2+$, so in this case $\Mn$ must have valence $4+$.  Thus for any $x \in [0, 1]$, the valence of $\Mn$ must be between $3+$ and $4+$.  The expected valence is $(3 + x)+$.
	
	When $\Mn$ ionizes, it loses its two $4s$ electrons first~\cite{LibreTexts}.  For $\LaMnO$~($x = 0$), it also loses one $3d$ electron, leaving it with $3d^4$, or $4 = 4 - x$ electrons in the $d$ levels.  For $\SrMnO$~($x = 1$), $\Mn$ loses two $3d$ electrons, leaving it with $3d^3$, or $3 = 4 - x$ electrons in the $d$ levels.  Therefore $\Mn$ loses an expected $1 + x$ electrons from its $3d$ levels, leaving it with $5 - (1 + x) = 4 - x$ remaining.
}



\prob{
	The degeneracy of the 5 $d$ levels in the free ion is split by the cubic environment into a low energy threefold degenerate subset (whose notation is $\ttg$) and a higher energy doubly degenerate orbital set ($\eg$).  Explain why the spin configurations of these levels for the $\Mnep$ and $\Mnrp$ ions are expected to be as shown in Fig.~6.12.
}

\sol{
	\begin{figure}[t] \centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,trim=7cm 22.25cm 8.5cm 4.25cm,clip]{6-12}

		\label{f3b}
	\end{figure}
	
	Figure~6.12 in the lecture notes is reproduced in Fig.~\ref{f3b}.  The lower-energy $\ttg$ levels will be filled first according to the aufbau principle.  By Hund's rule as mentioned on p.~107, all 5 $d$ levels will receive a single electron before any $d$ level receives a second electron.  This allows all of the electrons to have the same spin, which maximizes the total spin of the system.  Since this is a symmetric spin state, the electrons stay further apart due to Coulomb repulsion and therefore have lower energy than they would if they were not all aligned~\cite[pp.~307--308]{Kittel}.  This explains why $\Mnep$ has one electron in each of the three $\ttg$ levels, all with the same spin, and why the fourth electron of $\Mnrp$ is added to the $\eg$ level, again with all electrons having the same spin.
}



\prob{
	The lowest three electron states can be regarded as forming a classical spin $S = 3/2$ which has negligible hopping from site to site, whereas the highest state is potentially itinerant.  Now consider two neighboring sites $i, j$ in the solid, each having the same ``core'' spin $S$, and sharing a single itinerant $\eg$ electron, that has a tight-binding matrix element
	\eq{
		t = \mel*{\phiegrRi}{H}{\phiegrRj}
	}
	for hopping from site to site.
	
	In second-quantized notation, the full Hamiltonian can be written as
	\eq{
		H = t \sumijnn \sumsig \chdag_{i, \sig} \ch_{j, \sig} + U \sumi \nh_{i, \sig} \nh_{i, -\sig} - J \sumi \shi \vdot \vSi + \Jx \sumij \vSi \vdot \vSj.
	}
	Explain the origin of the terms
	\eq{
		\Hint = J \sumi \shi \vdot \vSi + \Jx \sumij \vSi \vdot \vSj
	}
	in the total Hamiltonian ($\shi$ is the spin of the $\eg$ electron) and suggest relative magnitudes of $U$, $J$, and $\Jx$.
}

\sol{
	The term with coefficient $J$ represents the alignment of the itinerant electron's spin with the core's spin at the same site.  That is, the larger $J$ is, the more compelled the itinerant electron is to align its spin with the core.  The term with coefficient $\Jx$ represents the alignment of the spins of the cores of neighboring $\Mn$ sites.  The itinerant electrons are more likely to hop between two $\Mn$ (from $\Mnrp$ to $\Mnep$) sites if their cores have the same spin direction~\cite{Double}.
	
	Similarly, $U$ is the ``coupling'' for antialignment of electrons within one $d$ level.  This is strongly disfavored by Hund's rule.  Further, it is more important for the itinerant electron to align its spin with its core than for adjacent $\Mn$ ions to have the same spin (the facilitation of hopping by the latter is more of an added bonus that reduces the system's kinetic, rather than potential, energy)~\cite{Double}.  Thus the relative magnitudes are $J \gg \Jx \gg U$.
}


\prob{
	Consider two neighboring core spins $\vSi, \vSj$ that are at a relative angle $\thtij$.  By considering that the spin wavefunction of the itinerant electron must, for $J \gg t$, be always aligned with the local core spin $\vS$, explain why the {\Schrodinger} equation for the itinerant electron can be simplified to one in which the tight-binding hopping matrix element from site $i$ to site $j$ is replaced by
	\eq{
		\teff = t \cos(\frac{\thtij}{2}).
	}
	To do this, you may wish to note that under a rotation by an angle $\tht$, the spin wavefunction transforms as
	\eq{
		\mqty( \kupp \\ \kdnp ) = \mqty( \cos(\tht / 2) & \sin(\tht / 2) \\ -\sin(\tht / 2) & \cos(\tht / 2) ) \mqty( \kup \\ \kdn ).
	}
	\vfix
}



\prob{
	Sketch the density of states of the itinerant electrons for different alignments of the core spins $\vS$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \emph{ferro}magnetic~(all core spins aligned),
		\item \emph{antiferro}magnetic~(all neighboring core spins anti-aligned),
		\item \emph{para}magnetic~(core spins randomly aligned).
	\end{enumerate}
	Discuss how the total free energies of these states differ, and suggest what is the magnetic ground state when $x = 0$, and when $t x > \Jx$; give rough estimates of the transition temperatures of the ordered magnetic states toward high temperature paramagnetism.
}



\prob{
	Figure~6.13 shows the resistivity as a function of temperature of several samples of $\LaSrMnO$ with different concentrations $x$, as well as the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity (which gives rise to the label ``colossal'' magnetoresistance).  Discuss this data in light of the results above.
