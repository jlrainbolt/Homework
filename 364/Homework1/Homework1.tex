\state{Twins paradox (MCP 2.16)}{\hfix}

\prob{
	The 4-acceleration of a particle or other object is defined by $\vaa \equiv \dv*{\vuu}{\tau}$, where $\vuu$ is its 4-velocity and $\tau$ is proper time along its world line.  Show that, if an observer carries an accelerometer, the magnitude $\abs{\ba}$ of the 3-dimensional acceleration $\ba$ measured by the accelerometer will always be equal to the magnitude of the observer's 4-acceleration, $\abs{\ba} = \abs{\vaa} \equiv \sqrt{\vaa \cdot \vaa}$.
}

\sol{
	The velocity and acceleration of the observer and of the accelerometer are the same.  From MCP~(2.25c), their 4-velocity can be written
	\eq{
		\vuu = (\gam, \gam \bv)
		= \gam (1, \bv),
	}
	where $\bv = \dv*{\xbb}{t}$ and $\xbb$ is the position in 3-space.  Then the acceleration is
	\eq{
		\vaa = \dv{\vuu}{\tau}
		= \gam \dv{\vuu}{t}
		= \gam \paren{ \dv{\gam}{t}, \bv \dv{\gam}{t} + \gam \dv{\bv}{t} },
	}
	since $\ddtau = \ddt / \gam$~\cite[p.~201]{Resnick}.  But in the rest frame of the accelerometer and observer, $\gam = 1$ and $\dv*{\gam}{t} = 0$.  So
	\eq{
		\vaa = \paren{ 0, \dv{\bv}{t} }
		= (0, \ba).
	}
	Then
	\eq{
		\ans{ \abs{\vaa} = \sqrt{ \vaa \cdot \vaa }
		= \sqrt{ \ba \vdot \ba }
		= \abs{\ba}, }
	}
	as we wanted to show. \qed

\prob{
	In the twins paradox of Fig.~2.8a, suppose that Florence begins at rest beside Methuselah, then accelerates in Methuselah's $x$-direction with an acceleration $a$ equal to one Earth gravity, $g$, for a time $\TFlo / 4$ as measured by her, then accelerates in the $-x$-direction at $g$ for a time $\TFlo / 2$, thereby reversing her motion; then she accelerates in the $+x$-direction at $g$ for a time $\TFlo / 4$, thereby returning to rest beside Methuselah.  (This is the type of motion shown in the figure.)  Show that the total time lapse as measured by Methuselah is
	\eqn{show5b}{
		\TMet = \frac{4}{g} \sinh(\frac{g \TFlo}{4}).
	}
}

\sol{
	Let $a$ be Florence's acceleration as measured in Methuselah's rest frame $\cF$.  For the first leg of her journey, Florence's proper acceleration is $\ab = g$.  The expression for the Lorentz transformation relating the proper acceleration is~\cite{Acceleration}
	\eq{
		\ab = \frac{a}{(1 - \bet^2)^{3/2}}.
	}
	Rearranging and substituting yields (for $c = 1$)
	\eq{
		a = g (1 - \bet^2)^{3/2}
		= g (1 - v^2)^{3/2},
	}
	where $v$ is Florence's velocity as observed by Methuselah.  Substituting $a = \dv*{v}{t}$ gives us a differential equation for $v$:
	\eq{
		\dv{v}{t} = g (1 - v)^{3/2}
		\qimplies
		\intov \frac{\ddvp}{(1 - {v'}^2)^{3/2}} = g \intot \ddtp
		\qimplies
		\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} = g t,
	}
	where we start counting at $t = 0$ for Methuselah, and Florence's initial velocity is 0.  (This integral and all following computations in this problem are performed using Mathematica.)  Solving for $v$ yields
	\eq{
		v = \frac{g t}{\sqrt{1 + (g t)^2}}.
	}
	Let $x$ be Florence's position as measured by Methuselah.  It may be found by substituting $v = \dv*{x}{t}$ and solving the resulting differential equation:
	\eq{
		\dv{x}{t} = \frac{g t}{\sqrt{1 + (g t)^2}}
		\qimplies
		\intox \ddxp = \intot \ddtp \frac{g t'}{\sqrt{1 + (g t')^2}}
		\qimplies x = \frac{\sqrt{(g t)^2 + 1} - 1}{g},
	}
	where we have placed Florence's initial position at $x = 0$.
	
	\hl{Then somehow we use} $\ddtau = \ddt / \gam$?
}


\prob{
	Show that in the geometrized units used here, Florence's acceleration (equal to acceleration of gravity at the surface of Earth) is $g = \SI{1.033}{\per\year}$.  Plot $\TMet$ as a function of $\TFlo$, and from your plot estimate $\TFlo$ if $\TMet$ is the age of the Universe, 14 billion years.
}

\sol{
	Note that
	\eq{
		c = 1
		\qimplies
		\SI{1}{\meter} \approx \frac{1}{\num{2.998e8}} \, \si{\second}
		\approx \SI{3.336e-9}{\second},
	}
	Using this relation to convert $g$ from SI units, as well as the fact that $\SI{1}{\year} \approx \SI{3.154e7}{\second}$,
	\eq{
		g = \SI{9.807}{\meter\per\square\second}
		= (\SI{9.807}{\per\square\second}) (\SI{3.336e-9}{\second})
		= (\SI{3.271e-8}{\per\second}) (\SI{3.154e7}{\second\per\year})
		\approx \ans{ \SI{1.033}{\per\year}, }
	}
	as we wanted to show. \qed
