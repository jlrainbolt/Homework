\state{}{
	Let $T$ be a rank one tensor which takes as argument vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space equipped with an inner product (either Euclidean with all spacelike directions or Lorenztian with one timelike direction).  Prove that there exists a vector $V$ such that for all vectors $W$,
	\eqn{show1}{
		\TW = V \cdot W.
	}
}

\sol{
	We can expand $W$ in terms of the basis vectors $\esi$:
	\eq{
		W = \Wi \esi.
	}
	By the linearity of tensors~\cite[p.~11]{MCP},
	\eq{
		T(\Wi \esi) = \Wi T(\esi).
	}
	We can also write the inner product in index notation:
	\eq{
		V \cdot W = \Vsi \Wi.
	}
	Then Eq.~\refeq{show1} holds so long as
	\eqn{V}{
		\ans{ \Vsi = T(\esi). }
	}
	This definition gives us
	\eq{
		\TW = T(\Wi \esi)
		= \Wi T(\esi)
		= \Wi \Vsi
		= V \cdot W,
	}
	for all $W$.  Thus we have proven that such a $V$ exists and has the form of Eq.~\refeq{V}. \qed
