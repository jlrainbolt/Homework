\state{Stress-energy tensor and energy-momentum conservation for a perfect fluid (MCP 2.26)}{\hfix}

\prob{
	Derive the frame-independent expression~(2.74b) for the perfect fluid stress-energy tensor from its rest-frame components~(2.74a).
}

\sol{
	From MCP~(2.74a), the nonzero rest-frame components of the tensor are
	\al{
		\Too &= \rho, &
		\Tjk &= P \deljk.
	}
	We know from MCP~(2.23c) that $\gab = \etaab$, and from (2.22) that $\eta_{00} = -1$, $\eta_{11} = \eta_{22} = \eta_{33} = 1$.  Then, using the form $\sT \equiv \Tab \vea \otimes \veb$ of (2.23a), we can write
	\al{
		\sT = (\rho + P) \veo \otimes \veo + P \sg.
	}
	Note that in the local rest frame, the fluid is stationary so its 4-velocity is $(1, 0, 0, 0)$.  That is, $\uv \otimes \uv$ simplifies to $\veo \otimes \veo$ in the local rest frame.  So the frame-independent expression is
	\eq{
		\ans{ \sT = (\rho + P) \uv \otimes \uv + P \sg, }
	}
	which is identical to (2.74b). \qed
}



\prob{
	Explain why the projection of $\vgrad \cdot \sT = 0$ along the fluid 4-velocity, $\uv \cdot (\vgrad \cdot \sT) = 0$, should represent energy conservation as viewed by the fluid itself.  Show that this equation reduces to
	\eq{
		\dv{\rho}{\tau} = -(\rho + P) \vgrad \cdot \uv.
	}
	With the aid of Eq.~(2.65), bring this into the form
	\eq{
		\dv{(\rho V)}{\tau} = -P \dv{V}{\tau},
	}
	where $V$ is the 3-volume of some small fluid element as measured in the fluid's local rest frame.  What are the physical interpretations of the left- and right-hand sides of this equation, and how is it related to the first law of thermodynamics?
}

\sol{
	We know from MCP~(2.73a) that $\vgrad \cdot \sT = 0$ represents local 4-momentum conservation.  In the rest frame of the fluid, this looks simply like a continuity relating energy density $\rho$ and pressure $P$, which can be thought of as ``energy flux'':
	\eq{
		0 = \vgrad \cdot \sT
		= \dv{\rho}{t} - \grad \vdot \bP,
	}
	where $\bP = (P, P, P)$.  In this case, $\uv \cdot \vgrad \cdot \sT = 0$ implies
	\eq{
		\dv{\rho}{t} = 0,
	}
	meaning that energy density is constant, so energy must be conserved.  \hl{The same laws of physics must also apply in all other inertial frames.}  %Now consider a in which the fluid is moving in the $x$ direction.  Then we have
%	\eq{
%		0 = \uv \cdot (\vgrad \cdot \sT) = 0
%	}
	Applying (2.74b) and the product rule, note that
	\al{
		\vgrad \cdot \sT &= \ptsa \Tab \\
		&= \ptsa [ (\rho + P) \ua \ub + P \gab ] \\
		&= \ua \ub \ptsa(\rho + P) + (\rho + P) (\ub \ptsa \ua + \ua \ptsa \ub) + \gab \ptsa P \\
		&= \ua \ub \ptsa(\rho + P) + (\rho + P) (\ub \ptsa \ua + \ua \ptsa \ub) + \ptb P.
	}
	Then
	\aln{
		\uv \cdot (\vgrad \cdot \sT) &= \usb \ptsa \Tab \notag \\
		&= \usb \ua \ub \ptsa(\rho + P) + \usb (\rho + P) (\ub \ptsa \ua + \ua \ptsa \ub) + \usb \ptb P \notag \\
		&= -\ua \ptsa(\rho + P) + (\rho + P) (-\ptsa \ua + \usb \ua \ptsa \ub) + \usb \ptb P \notag \\
		&= -\ua \ptsa(\rho + P) - (\rho + P) \ptsa \ua + \usb \ptb P, \label{thing1b}
	}
	where we have used MCP~(2.9), $\uv^2 = -1$, and that as a consequence,
	\eq{
		0 = \ptsa(\usb \ub) = \ub \ptsa \usb + \usb \ptsa \ub
		\qimplies
		\ub \ptsa \usb = -\usb \ptsa \ub
		\qimplies
		\ub \ptsa \usb = \usb \ptsa \ub = 0.
	}
	Picking back up at Eq.~\refeq{thing1b},
	\eq{
		\uv \cdot (\vgrad \cdot \sT) = -\ua \ptsa \rho - \ua \ptsa P - (\rho + P) \ptsa \ua + \usb \ptb P
		= -\ua \ptsa \rho - (\rho + P) \ptsa \ua.
	}
%		&= -\ptsa (\rho \ua) - P \ptsa \ua \label{thing2b2}
%	}
%	where we have used the product rule:
%	\eq{
%		\ptsa (\rho \ua) = \ua \ptsa \rho + \rho \ptsa \ua.
%	}
	Applying $\uv \cdot (\vgrad \cdot \sT) = 0$ and assuming $\rho$ is \hl{divergenceless}, this becomes
	\eq{
		\ua \ptsa \rho = -(\rho + P) \ptsa \ua
		\qimplies
		\dv{\rho}{t} + \ui \dv{\rho}{\xii} = -(\rho + P) \vgrad \cdot \uv
		\qimplies
		\ans{ \dv{\rho}{t} = -(\rho + P) \vgrad \cdot \uv, }
	}
	as we wanted to show. \qed

\prob{
	Read the discussion in Ex.~2.10 about the tensor $\sP = \sg + \uv \otimes \uv$ that projects into the 3-space of the fluid's rest frame.  Explain why $\Psab \Tabsb = 0$ should represent the law of force balance (momentum conservation) as seen by the fluid.  Show that this equation reduces to
	\eq{
		(\rho + P) \av = -\sP \cdot \grad P,
	}
	where $\av = \dv*{\uv}{\tau}$ is the fluid's 4-acceleration.  This equation is a relativistic version of Newton's $\Fb = m \ab$.    Explain the physical meanings of the left- and right-hand sides.  Infer that $\rho + P$ must be the fluid's inertial mass per unit volume.  It is also the enthalpy per unit volume, including the contribution of rest mass; see Ex.~5.5 and Box~13.2.

\state{Inertial mass per unit volume (MCP 2.27)}{
	Suppose that some medium has a rest frame (unprimed frame) in which its energy flux and momentum density vanish, $\Toj = \Tjo = 0$.  Suppose that the medium moves in the $x$ direction with speed very small compared to light, $v \ll 1$, as seen in a (primed) laboratory frame, and ignore factors of order $v^2$.  The ratio of the medium's momentum density $\Gjp = \Tjpop$ (as measured in the laboratory frame) to its velocity $\vsi = \delsix$ is called its total \emph{inertial mass per unit volume} and is denoted $\rhosjiinert$:
	\eq{
		\Tjpop = \rhosjiinert \vsi.
	}
	In other words, $\rhosjiinert$ is the 3-dimensional tensor that gives the momentum density $\Gjp$ when the medium's small velocity is put into its second slot.
}

\prob{
	Using a Lorentz transformation from the medium's (unprimed) rest frame to the (primed) laboratory frame, show that
	\eq{
		\rhosjiinert = \Too \delsji + \Tsji.
	}
}



\prob{
	Give a physical explanation of the contribution $\Tsji$ to the momentum density.
}



\prob{
	Show that for a perfect fluid [Eq.~(2.74b)] the inertial mass per unit volume is isotropic and has magnitude $\rho + P$, where $\rho$ is the mass-energy density, and $P$ is the pressure measured in the fluid's rest frame:
	\eq{
		\rhosjiinert = (\rho + P) \delsji.
	}
	See Ex.~2.26 for this inertial-mass role of $\rho + P$ in the law of force balance.

\state{Index-manipulation rules from duality (MCP 24.4)}{
	For an arbitrary basis $\{ \vesa \}$ and its dual basis $\{ \vem \}$, use (i)~the duality relation~(24.8), (ii)~the definition~(24.9) of components of a tensor, and (iii)~the relation $\vA \cdot \vB = \sg(\vA, \vB)$ between the metric and the inner product to deduce the following results.
}

\prob{
	The relations
	\al{
		\vem &= \sgma \vesa, &
		\vesa &= \sgsam \vem.
	}
	\vfix
}



\prob{
	The fact that indices on the components of tensors can be raised and lowered using the components of the metric:
	\al{
		\Fmn &= \sgma \Fsasn, &
		\psa &= \sgsab \pbet.
	}
	\vfix
}



\prob{
	The fact that a tensor can be reconstructed from its components in the manner of Eq.~(24.11).

\state{Transformation matrices for circular polar bases (MCP 24.5)}{
	Consider the circular polar coordinate system $\{ \vpi, \phi \}$ and its coordinate bases and orthonormal bases as shown in Fig.~24.3 and discussed in the associated text.  These coordinates are related to Cartesian coordinates $\{ x, y \}$ by the usual relations: $x = \vpi \cos\phi$, $y = \vpi \sin\phi$.
}

\prob{
	Evaluate the components ($\Lxsvpi$, etc.) of the transformation matrix that links the two coordinate bases $\{ \vex, \vey \}$.  Also evaluate the components ($\Lvpisx$, etc.) of the inverse transformation matrix. 
}



\prob{
	Similarly, evaluate the components of the transformation matrix and its inverse linking the bases $\{ \vex, \vey \}$ and $\{ \vevpih, \vephih \}$.
}



\prob{
	Consider the vector $\vA = \vex + 2 \vey$.  What are its components in the other two bases?
}






\state{Gauss's theorem (MCP 24.11)}{
	In 3-dimensional Euclidean space Maxwell's equation $\grad \vdot \bE = \rhoe / \epso$ can be combined with Gauss's theorem to show that the electric flux through the surface $\pt\cV$ of a sphere is equal to the charge in the sphere's interior $\cV$ divided by $\epso$:
	\eq{
		\intdV \bE \vdot d\bSig = \intV \frac{\rhoe}{\epso} \ddV.
	}
	Introduce spherical polar coordinates so the sphere's surface is at some radius $r = R$.  Consider a surface element on the sphere's surface with vectorial legs $\ddphi \pdv*{\phi}$ and $\ddtht \pdv*{\tht}$.  Evaluate the components $\ddSigj$ of the surface integration element $\ddbSig = \beps(\ldots, \ddtht \pdv*{\tht}, \ddphi \pdv*{\phi})$.  (Here $\beps$ is the Levi-Civita tensor.)  Similarly, evaluate $\ddV$ in terms of vectorial legs in the sphere's interior.  Then use these results for $\ddSigj$ and $\ddV$ to convert Eq.~(24.47) into an explicit form in terms of integrals over $r$, $\tht$, and $\phi$.  The final answer should be obvious, but the above steps in deriving it are informative.
