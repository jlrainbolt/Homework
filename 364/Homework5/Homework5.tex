\state{Curvature-coupling torque~(MCP 25.16)}{\hfix}

\prob{
	In the Newtonian theory of gravity, consider an axisymmetric, spinning body (e.g., Earth) with spin angular momentum $\Sj$ and time-independent mass distribution $\rho(\bx)$, interacting with an externally produced tidal gravitational field $\cEsjk$ (e.g., that of the Sun and the Moon).  Show that the torque around the body's center of mass, exerted by the tidal field, and the resulting evolution of the body's spin are
	\eqn{show6a}{
		\dv{\Ssi}{t} = -\epssijk \cIsjl \cEskl.
	}
	Here
	\eq{
		\cIskl = \int \rho \paren{ \xsk \xsl - \frac{1}{3} r^2 \delskl } \ddV
	}
	is the body's mass quadrupole moment, with $r = \sqrt{\delsij \xsi \xsj}$ the distance from the center of mass.
}

\sol{
	Torque is defined by
	\eq{
		\btau = \br \cross \bF
		\qimplies
		\tau_i = \eps_{i j k} x_j F_k.
	}
	We take $\btau = \dv*{\bS}{t}$ as given.  Then for a mass density~\cite[p.~110]{Muller}, applying Newton's second law yields
	\eqn{thing6a}{
		\dv{\Ssi}{t} = \eps_{i j k} \int \rho x_j g_k \ddV,
	}
	where the acceleration $\bg$ is due only to the tidal field.  From Eq.~\refeq{show1a}, this gives us
	\eq{
		g_k = -\cE_{k l} r n_l
		= -\cE_{k l} x_l,
	}
	where we have used the symmetry of $\bcE$~\cite[p.~1208]{MCP}.  Making this substitution in Eq.~\refeq{thing6a},
	\eqn{thing6a2}{
		\dv{\Ssi}{t} = -\eps_{i j k} \cE_{k l} \int \rho x_j x_l \ddV.
	}
	The Taylor expansion of an arbitrary function $v(\br - \bR)$ about the origin $\br = \bo$ can be written
	\eq{
		r_\alp r_\bet v_{\alp \bet}(\bR) = \frac{1}{3} (3 r_\alp r_\bet - \del_{\alp \bet} r^2) v_{\alp \bet}(\bR),
	}
	so long as $v_{\alp \alp}(\bR) = 0$; that is, $v(\bR)$ satisfies the Laplace equation~\cite{Multipole}.  We would need $\eps_{i \alp k} \cE_{k \alp} = 0$, which is true:
	\al{
		\eps_{i \alp k} \cE_{k \alp} &= \eps_{i 1 2} \cE_{2 1} + \eps_{i 1 3} \cE_{3 1} + \eps_{i 2 1} \cE_{1 2} + \eps_{i 2 3} \cE_{3 2} + \eps_{i 3 1} \cE_{1 3} + \eps_{i 3 2} \cE_{2 3} \\
		&= \eps_{i 1 2} \cE_{1 2} + \eps_{i 1 3} \cE_{1 3} - \eps_{i 1 2} \cE_{1 2} + \eps_{i 2 3} \cE_{2 3} - \eps_{i 1 3} \cE_{1 3} - \eps_{i 2 3} \cE_{2 3} \\
		&= 0,
	}
	where we have again used the symmetry of $\bcE$.  Now we can write Eq.~\refeq{thing6a2} as
	\eq{
		\ans{ \dv{\Ssi}{t} =\ } {-\eps_{i j k}} \cE_{k l} \int \rho \paren{ x_j x_l - \frac{1}{3} r^2 \del_{j l} } \ddV
		\ans{\, \equiv -\epssijk \cIsjl \cEskl, }
	}
	where we have defined
	\eq{
		\ans{ \cIskl \equiv \int \rho \paren{ \xsk \xsl - \frac{1}{3} r^2 \delskl } \ddV, }
	}
	which is what we wanted to show. \qed
}



\prob{
	For the centrifugally flattened Earth interacting with the tidal fields of the Moon and the Sun, estimate in order of magnitude the spin-precession period produced by this torque.  (The observed precession period is 26,000 years.)
}

\sol{
	I couldn't figure out how to do this one either.
}



\prob{
	Show that when rewritten in the language of general relativity, and in frame-independent, geometric language, Eq.~\refeq{show6a} takes the form (25.59) discussed in the text.  As part of showing this, explain the meaning of $\cIsbm$ in that equation.
}

\sol{
	MCP~(25.59) is
	\eq{
		\fv{S}{\alp}{; \mu} u^\mu = \eps^{\alp \bet \gam \del} \cI_{\bet \mu} \fv{R}{\mu}{\nu \gam \zet} u_\del u^\nu u^\zet.
	}
	In the proper rest frame of the Earth, $\vuu = (1, \bo)$.  So the left-hand side of Eq.~\refeq{show6a} is
	\eqn{lhs6}{
		\dv{S^i}{t} = \nabla_{\! 0} S^i
		\to (\nabsm S^i) u^\mu
		= \fv{S}{i}{; \mu} u^\mu.
	}
	By MCP~(25.25), in the local rest frame of two particles with a relative acceleration,
	\eq{
		\fv{R}{j}{0 k 0} = \cEsjk,
	}
	and by symmetry $\fv{R}{j}{0 k 0} = \fv{R}{k}{0 j 0}$.  Given that $\vuu = (1, \bo)$ in the Earth's proper rest frame, we have
	\eqn{r6}{
		\cEsjk = \fv{R}{k}{0 j 0} \to \fv{R}{k}{\nu j \zet} u^\nu u^\zet.
	}
	Similarly,
	\eqn{eps6}{
		\eps^{i j k} = \eps^{0 i j k}
		= \eps^{i j k 0}
		\to \eps^{i j k \del} u_\del.
	}
	Feeding Eqs.~\refeq{lhs6}, \refeq{r6}, and \refeq{eps6} into Eq.~\refeq{show6a}, we have
	\eq{
		\ans{ \fv{S}{\alp}{; \mu} u^\mu = -\eps^{\alp \bet \gam \del} \cI_{\bet \mu} \fv{R}{\mu}{\nu \gam \zet} u_\del u^\nu u^\zet, }
	}
	which is a minus sign away from what we wanted to show.
