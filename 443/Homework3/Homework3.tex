\state{Aspects of scaling behavior in QFT}{\hfix}

\prob{}{
	As discussed in class, massless free scalar field theory is invariant under scale transformations if we assign the appropriate scale dimension to the field $\phi$.  The action of dilations on coordinates is implemented by the operator $D = i \xm \ptsm$.  Find the commutation relations of this operator with the operators that implement the Poincar\'{e} algebra of translations $\Psm = i \ptsm$ and Lorentz transformations $\Jsmn = i (\xsm \ptsn - \xsn \ptsm)$.  Find the canonical Noether current and Noether charge for this symmetry in the free field theory, and find the commutation relations of the charge with the field $\phi$ to show that it implements the infinitesimal form of the symmetry on the fields.  Check also that this current has the right commutation relations with the field theory Hamiltonian and momentum generators.
}

\sol{
	Firstly, the commutators of the operators are
	\eq{
		[D, \Psm] = -\xnu \ptsn \ptsm + \ptsm \xnu \ptsn
		= -\xnu \ptsn \ptsm + \ptsm(\xsn) \ptn + \xnu \ptsn \ptsm
		= \delsmn \ptn
		= \ptsm
		= \ans{ -i \Psm, }
	}
	and
	\al{
		[D, \Jsmn] &= -\xa \ptsa (\xsm \ptsn - \xsn \ptsm) + (\xsm \ptsn - \xsn \ptsm) \xa \ptsa \\[1ex]
		&= -\xa \ptsa(\xsm \ptsn) + \xa \ptsa(\xsn \ptsm) + \xsm \ptsn(\xa \ptsa) - \xsn \ptsm(\xa \ptsa) \\[1ex]
		&= -\xa \ptsa(\xsm) \ptsn - \xa \xsm \ptsa \ptsn + \xa \ptsa(\xsn) \ptsm + \xa \xsn \ptsa \ptsm + \xsm \ptsn(\xsa) \pta + \xsm \xa \ptsn \ptsa - \xsn \ptsm(\xsa) \pta \\
		&\hspace{5em} \phantom{=\ } - \xsn \xa \ptsm \ptsa \\[1ex]
		&= -\xa \delsma \ptsn - \xa \xsm \ptsa \ptsn + \xa \delsna \ptsm + \xa \xsn \ptsa \ptsm + \xsm \delsna \pta + \xsm \xa \ptsn \ptsa - \xsn \delsma \pta - \xsn \xa \ptsm \ptsa \\[1ex]
		&= -\xsm \ptsn - \xa \xsm \ptsa \ptsn + \xsn \ptsm + \xa \xsn \ptsa \ptsm + \xsm \ptsn + \xsm \xa \ptsn \ptsa - \xsn \ptsm - \xsn \xa \ptsm \ptsa \\[1ex]
		&= \ans{ 0. }
	}
	
	The conserved charge is given in general by Peskin \& Schroeder~(2.12) and (2.13),
	\aln{
		Q &\equiv \int_\text{all space} \jo \ddcx, &
		\where \jmx &= \pdv{\cL}{(\ptsm\phi)} \Del\phi - \Jm,
	}
	where $\jmx$ is a Noether current and $\Jm$ is a 4-divergence that arises when transforming the Lagrangian as in Peskin \& Schroeder~(2.10):
	\eq{
		\cLx \to \cLx + \alp \ptsm \Jmx.
	}
	The Lagrangian of the massless free scalar field theory can be written from Peskin \& Schroeder~(2.14),
	\eq{
		\cL = \ptm \phis \ptsm \phi.
	}
	A dilation can be written $\phi \to e^{i \alp D} \phi$~\cite[p.~18]{Peskin}.  Then
	\eq{
		\cL \to \frac{1}{2} \ptsm e^{-i \alp D} \phis \ptm e^{i \alp D} \phi
		= \frac{1}{2} \ptsm e^{-i \alp D} \phis (e^{i \alp D} \ptsm + i \ptsm) \phi
	}
	The infinitesimal transformations, by analogy with Peskin \& Schroeder~(2.15), are
	\al{
		\alp \Del\phi &= i \alp D \phi, &
		\alp \Del\phis &= -i \alp D \phis.
	}
	Then the Noether current is
	\eq{
		\jmx = \pdv{\cL}{(\ptsm\phi)} \Del\phi + \pdv{\cL}{(\ptsm\phis)} \Del\phis
		= \ans{ i \ptm(\phis) D \phi - i \ptsm(\phi) D \phis, }
	}
	and the Noether charge is
	\eq{
		Q = i \int \ddcx [ \pto(\phis) D \phi - \ptso(\phid) D \phis ]
		= \ans{ i \int \ddcx (\phids D \phi - \phid D \phis). }
	}
	
	From~2(a) of Homework 1, we know the momenta conjugate to $\phi$ and $\phis$,
	\al{
		\pi &= \phids, &
		\pis &= \phid,
	}
	and the commutation relations
	\al{
		[\phivx, \pivy] &= [\phisvx, \pisvy] = i \,\del^3(\vx - \vy), \\
		[\phivx, \phivy] &= [\phisvx, \phisvy] = 0, \\
		[\pivx, \pivy] &= [\pisvx, \pisvy] = 0, \\
		[\phivx, \pisvy] &= [\phivx, \phisvy] = [\pivx, \pisvy] = 0.
	}

	The commutation relation between the charge and the field is
	\al{
		[ \phiy, \Qx  ] &= i \brac{ \phiy, \int \ddcx [ \pix D \phix - \pisx D \phisx ] } \\
		&= i \int \ddcx \curly{ [ \phiy, \pix ] D \phix - [ \phiy, \pisx D \phisx ] } \\
		&= i \int \ddcx \curly{ [ \phiy, \pix ] D \phix - i \pisx [ \phiy, \xm \ptsm \phisx ] } \\
		&= \int \ddcx \curly{ i [ \phiy, \pix ] D \phix + \pisx [ \phiy, \paren{ t \pix + \xii \ptsi \phisx } ] } \\
		&= \int \ddcx \curly{ i [ \phiy, \pix ] D \phix + t \pisx [ \phiy, \pix ] } \\
		&= i \int \ddcx \brac{ i D \phix + t \pisx } \del^3(\vy - \vx) \\
		&= i t \pisy - D \phiy \\
		&= i t \pisy - i \xm \ptsm \phiy \\
		&= i [ t \pisy - t \pisy - \xii \ptsi \phiy ] \\
		&= \ans{ i [ \vy \vdot \grad \phiy ] }
	}
	where $x = (t, \vx)$ and $y = (t, \vy)$.  This is the infinitesimal form of a spatial dilation on the field.

\prob{}{
	The sound waves in a solid obey a wave equation, which at low enough wavelengths/energies is described by the action (for simplicity, consider one spatial dimension)
	\eq{
		\So = \int \ddtx (\ptst \phi \ptst \phi - \cs^2 \ptsx \phi \ptsx \phi)
	}
	where $\cs$ is the speed of sound in the material.  The field $\phi$ describes the distortion of the lattice away from equilibrium.  Model this situation by a lattice of atoms (mass $m$, lattice spacing $a$) interacting through harmonic nearest-neighbor forces (spring constant $k$).  Find the leading term in the action which corrects the above kinetic energy in a power series in $a \times (\text{derivatives})$ (this can be done for instance by expanding the exact dispersion relation for the chain of masses and springs).  Show that this correction term is an irrelevant perturbation of the action, so that all traces of the lattice structure disappear in the continuum limit $a \to 0$ (e.g.~all traces of the structure of interactions at the atomic level---such as a general potential $\Vr$ between the atoms rather than harmonic forces---disappear, being summarized in the constant $\cs$, and the effective action $\So$ is independent of the cutoff $a$).  Estimate the momentum scale at which the irrelevant corrections amount to 10\% of the total energy of a phonon.
