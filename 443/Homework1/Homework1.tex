\state{The complex scalar field (Peskin \& Schroeder 2.2)}{
	Consider the field theory of a complex-valued scalar field obeying the Klein-Gordon equation.  The action of this theory is
	\eq{
		S = \int \ddqx (\ptsm \phis \ptm \phi - m^2 \phis \phi).
	}
	It is easiest to analyze this theory by considering $\phix$ and $\phisx$, rather than the real and imaginary parts of $\phix$, as the basic dynamical variables.
}



\prob{}{
	Find the conjugate momenta to $\phix$ and $\phisx$ and the canonical commutation relations.  Show that the Hamiltonian is
	\eq{
		H = \int \ddcx (\pis \pi + \grad \phis \vdot  \grad \phi + m^2 \phis \phi).
	}
	Compute the Heisenberg equation of motion for $\phix$ and show that it is indeed the Klein-Gordon equation.
}



%\prob{}{
%	Diagonalize $H$ by introducing creation and annihilation operators.  Show that the theory contains two sets of particles of mass $m$.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	\label{2.3(c)}
%	
%	Rewrite the conserved charge
%	\eq{
%		Q = \int \ddcx \frac{i}{2} (\phis \pis - \pi \phi)
%	}
%	in terms of creation and annihilation operators, and evaluate the charge of the particles of each type.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Consider the case of two complex Klein-Gordon fields with the same mass.  Label the fields as $\phiax$, where $a = 1, 2$.  Show that there are now four conserved charges, one given by the generalization of part~\ref{2.3(c)}, and the other three given by
%	\eq{
%		\Qi = \int \ddcx \frac{i}{2} (\phias \sigiab \pibs - \pia \sigiab \phib),
%	}
%	where $\sigi$ are the Pauli sigma matrices.  Show that these three charges have the commutation relations of angular momentum ($SU(2)$).  Generalize these results to the case of $n$ identical complex scalar fields.
%}






%\state{(Peskin \& Schroeder 2.3)}{
%	\label{3}
%	
%	Evaluate the function
%	\eq{
%		\ev{\phix \, \phiy}{0} = D(x - y)
%	= \int \ddpf \frac{1}{2 \Ep} e^{i p \, (x - y)},
%	}
%	for $(x - y)$ spacelike so that $(x - y)^2 = -r^2$, explicitly in terms of Bessel functions.
%}






%\state{}{
%	The classical limit of a harmonic oscillator can be described in terms of \emph{coherent states},
%	\eq{
%		\kalp = \exp( \alp \adag - \frac{1}{2} |\alp|^2 ) \ko.
%	}
%	When $\alp$ is large, the oscillator state is semiclassical.  Proceeding similarly for the Fourier modes of the quantum Klein-Gordon field,
%	\al{
%		\kf &= \Nf \exp( i \int \ddpf \fp \, \apdag ) \ko, &
%		\Nf &= \exp( -\frac{1}{2} \int \ddpf | \fp |^2 ).
%	}
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Evaluate the expectation value of the field operator $\ev{\phix}{f}$ and show that it satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Evaluate the relative mean square fluctuation of the occupation number of the mode with momentum $\vp$ and the relative mean square fluctuation in the total energy:
%	\al{
%		&\frac{\evnhps - \evnhp^2}{\evnhp^2}, &
%		&\frac{\evHs - \evH^2}{\evH^2}.
%	}
%	Is either of these a good measure of the degree to which the field is classical?  Justify your answer.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Take $\Delta(x - y) = \ev{\phivx \, \phivy}{0}$ (equal times) as a measure of the fluctuations or correlations of the field amplitude.  Use your result from problem~\ref{3} to evaluate this quantity.  What is the meaning of the divergence as $\vx \to \vy$?
