	Classical electromagnetism (with no sources) follows from the action
	\aln{ \label{action1.a}

	Derive Maxwell's equations as the Euler-Lagrange equations of this action, treating the components $\Asm(x)$ as the dynamical variables.  Write the equations in standard form by identifying
	\aln{ \label{identities1.a}

\sol{
	We want to extremize the action,
	\eq{
		S[\Asm] = \int \ddqx \cL(\Asm, \ptsm \Asm)
	}
	Let $\del\Asm$ denote some arbitrary variation that vanishes at the boundaries of spacetime.  The action for $\Asm + \del\Asm$ is
	\eq{
		S[\Asm + \del\Asm] = \int \ddqx \cL(\Asm + \del\Asm, \ptsn\Asm + \ptsn\del\Asm).
	}
	Then, to first order in $\del\Asm$, the variation of the action is
	\eq{
		\del S = S[\Asm + \del\Asm] - S[\Asm],
	}
	which we want to vanish for all $\del\Asm$.  Let $\del\Fsmn = \ptsm \, \del\Asn - \ptsn \, \del\Asm$.  Then, applying the definition of $\Fsmn$ given in Eq.~\refeq{action1.a},
	\aln{
		\del S &= \int  \ddqx \paren{ -\frac{1}{4} (\Fsmn + \del\Fsmn) (\Fmn + \del\Fmn) + \frac{1}{4} \Fsmn \Fmn } \notag \\
		&\approx \int \ddqx \paren{ -\frac{1}{4} (\Fsmn \Fmn + \Fsmn \,\del\Fmn + \del\Fsmn \,\Fmn) + \frac{1}{4} \Fsmn \Fmn } \notag \\
		&= \int \ddqx \paren{ -\frac{1}{4} (\Fsmn \,\del\Fmn + \del\Fsmn \,\Fmn) } \notag \\
		&= \int \ddqx \paren{ -\frac{1}{2} \del\Fsmn \,\Fmn }, \label{delS1.a}
	}
	where we have discarded terms of $\order{(\del\Am)^2}$ and swapped covariant and contravariant indices in going to the final equality.
	
	Note that
	\aln{
		\del\Fsmn \,\Fmn &= (\ptsm \del\Asn - \ptsn \del\Asm) (\ptm \An - \ptn \Am) \notag \\
		&= \ptsm \del\Asn \,\ptm \An - \ptsm \del\Asn \,\ptn \Am - \ptsn \del\Asm \,\ptm \An + \ptsn \del\Asm \,\ptn \Am.  \label{exp1.a}
	}
	Integrating the first term of Eq.~\refeq{exp1.a} by parts, we have
	\al{
		\int \ddqx \pdv{\,\del\Asn}{\xm} \pdv{\An}{\xsm} = \bigg[ \del\Asn \pdv{\An}{\xsm} \bigg]_{-\infty}^\infty - \int \ddqx \del\Asn \pdv{\An}{\xm}{\xsm}
		= -\int \ddqx \del\Asn \,\ptsm \ptm \An,
	}
	because $\del\An$ vanishes at $\pm\infty$.  The other terms follow similarly.  Then we find
	\al{
		\int \ddqx \del\Fsmn \,\Fmn &= -\int \ddqx (\del\Asn \,\ptsm \ptm \An - \del\Asn \,\ptsm \ptn \Am - \del\Asm \,\ptsn \ptm \An + \del\Asm \,\ptsn \ptn \Am) \\
		&= -\int \ddqx (\del\Asn \,\ptsm \Fmn + \del\Asm \,\ptsn \Fnm)
		= -\int \ddqx (\del\Asn \,\ptsm \Fmn + \del\Asn \,\ptsm \Fmn) \\
		&= -2 \int \ddqx \del\Asn \,\ptsm \Fmn,
	}
	where in going to the second-to-last equality we have simply swapped the indices.
	
	Making this substitution in Eq.~\refeq{delS1.a}, we obtain
	\eq{
		\del S = \del\Asn \int \ddqx \ptsm \Fmn.
	}
	In order for the action to be at a local extremum, we need $\del S = 0$ for any $\del\Asn$.  This implies that the integrand is 0.  Thus, we obtain
	\eqn{maxwell1.a}{
		\ans{ \ptsm \Fmn = 0, }
	}
	which is the covariant form of the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations in a source-free region~\cite[p.~557]{Jackson}, as we sought to derive. \qed
	
	From Eq.~\refeq{identities1.a} and the knowledge that $\Fmn$ is antisymmetric~\cite[p.~556]{Jackson}, we can write
	\eq{
		\Fmn = \mqty[
			0 & -\Ex & -\Ey & -\Ez \\
			\Ex & 0 & -\Bz & \By \\
			\Ey & \Bz & 0 & -\Bx \\
			\Ez & -\By & \Bx & 0
		].
	}
	The first equation of Eq.~\refeq{identities1.a} is equivalent to $\Ei = \Fio$.  Then the zeroth component of Eq.~\refeq{maxwell1.a} can be written
	\eq{
		\ptsm \Fmo = \pdv{\Ex}{x} + \pdv{\Ey}{y} + \pdv{\Ez}{z}
		= \ans{ \grad \vdot \vE
		= 0, }
	}
	which is the differential form of Gauss's law.
	
	For the remaining components of Eq.~\refeq{maxwell1.a}, we apply the second equation of Eq.~\refeq{maxwell1.a} to find
	\eq{
		\ptsm \Fmi = -\pdv{\Ei}{t} + \epsijk \pdv{\Bk}{\xj} = 0.
	}
	In vector form, this is
	\eq{
		\ans{ \grad \cross \vB - \pdv{\vE}{t} = \vo, }
	}
	the differential form of Amp\`{e}re's law.

%\prob{}{
%	Construct the energy-momentum tensor for this theory.  Note that the usual procedure does not result in a symmetric tensor.  To remedy that, we can add to $\Tmn$ a term of the form $\ptsl \Klmn$, where $\Klmn$ is antisymmetric in its first two indices.  Such an object is automatically divergenceless, so
%	\eq{
%		\Thmn = \Tmn + \ptsl \Klmn
%	}
