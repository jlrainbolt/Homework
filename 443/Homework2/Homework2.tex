%\state{Majorana fermions (Peskin \& Schroeder 3.4)}{
%	Recall from Eq.~(3.40) that one can write a relativistic equation for a massless 2-component fermion field that transforms as the upper two components of a Dirac spinor ($\psiL$).  Call such a 2-component field $\chiax$, $a = 1, 2$.
%}

%\prob{}{	\label{3.4a}
%	Show that it is possible to write an equation for $\chix$ as a massive field in the following way:
%	\eq{
%		i \sigb \cdot \partial \chi - i m \sig^2 \chis = 0.
%	}
%	That is, show, first, that this equation is relativistically invariant and, second, that it implies the Klein-Gordon equation, $(\partial^2 + m^2) \chi = 0$.  This form of the fermion mass is called a Majorana mass term.
%}



%\prob{}{	\label{3.4b}
%	Does the Majorana equation follow from a Lagrangian?  The mass term would seem to be the variation of $\sigsab \chias \chibs$; however, since $\sig^2$ is antisymmetric, this expression would vanish if $\chix$ were an ordinary c-number field.  When we go to quantum field theory, we know that $\chix$ will become an anticommuting quantum field.  Therefore, it makes sense to develop its classical theory by considering $\chix$ as a classical anticommuting field, that is, as a field that takes as values \emph{Grassmann nu{\omg^{\mu \nu}}mbers} which satisfy
%	\al{
%		\alp \bet &= -\bet \alp, &
%		\text{for any } \alp, \bet.
%	}
%	Note that this relation implies that $\alp^2 = 0$.  A Grassmann field $\xix$ can be expanded in a basis of functions as
%	\eq{
%		\xix = \sumn \alpn \phinx,
%	}
%	where the $\phinx$ are orthogonal c-number functions and the $\alpn$ are a set of independent Grassmann numbers.  Define the complex conjugate of a profuct of Grassmann numbers to reverse the order:
%	\eq{
%		(\alp \bet)^* = \bets \alps
%		= -\alps \bets.
%	}
%	This rule imitates the Hermitian conjugation of quantum fields.  Show that the classical action,
%	\eq{
%		S = \int \ddqx \brac{ \chidag i \sigb \cdot \partial \chi + \frac{i m}{2} \paren{ \chiT \sig^2 \chi - \chidag \sig^2 \chis } },
%	}
%	(where $\chidag = (\chis)^T$) is real ($\Ss = S$), and that varying this $S$ with respect to $\chi$ and $\chis$ yields the Majorana equation.
%}



%\prob{}{	\label{3.4c}
%	Let us write a 4-component Dirac field as
%	\eq{
%		\psix = \mqty( \psiL \\ \psiR ),
%	}{\omg^{\mu \nu}}
%	and recall that the lower components of $\psi$ transform in a way equivalent by a unitary transformation to the complex conjugate of the representation $\psiL$.  In this way, we can rewrite the 4-component Dirac field in terms of two 2-component spinors:
%	\al{
%		\psiLx &= \chiqx, &
%		\psiRx &= i \sig^2 \chiwsx.
%	}
%	Rewrite the Dirac Lagrangian in terms of $\chiq$ and $\chiw$ and note the form of the mass term.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Show that the action of \ref{3.4c} has a global symmetry.  Compute the divergences of the currents
%	\al{
%		\Jm &= \chidag \sigbm \chi, &
%		\Jm &= \chiqdag \sigbm \chiq - \chiwdag \sigbm \chiw,
%	}
%	for the theories of \ref{3.4b} and \ref{3.4c}, respectively, and relate your results to the symmetries of those theories.  Construct a theory of $N$ free massive 2-component fermion fields with $\order{N}$ symmetry (that is, the symmetry of rotations in an $N$-dimensional space).
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Quantize the Majorana theory of \ref{3.4a} and \ref{3.4b}.  That is, promote $\chix$ to a quantum field satisfying the canonical anticommutation relation
%	\eq{
%		\{ \chiavx, \chibdagvy \} = \delsab \del^3(\vx - \vy),
%	}
%	construct a Hermitian Hamiltonian, and find a representation of the canonical anticommutation relations that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian in terms of a set of creation and annihilation operators.  (Hint: Compare $\chix$ to the top two components of the quantized Dirac field.)
%}






%\state{(Peskin \& Schroeder 3.7)}{
%	This problem concerns the discrete symmetries $P$, $C$, and $T$.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Compute the transformation properties under $P$, $C$, and $T$ of the antisymmetric tensor fermion bilinears, $\psib \sigmn \psi$, with $\sigmn = \frac{i}{2} [\gamm, \gamn]$.  This completes the table of the transformation properties of bilinears at the end of the chapter.
%}



%\prob{}{
%	Let $\phix$ be a complex-valued Klein-Gordon field, such as we considered in Problem~2.2.  Find unitary operators $P$, $C$, and an antiunitary operator $T$ (all defined in terms of their action on the annihilation operators $\ap$ and $\bp$ for the Klein-Gordon particles and antiparticles) that give the following transformations of the Klein-Gordon field:
%	\al{
%		P \phitx P &= \phitmx, &
%		T \phitx T &= \phimtx, &
%		C \phitx C &= \phistx.

%	Find the transformation properties of the components of the current
%	\eq{

%\prob{}{
%	Show that any Hermitian Lorentz-scalar local operator built from $\psix$, $\phix$, and their conjugates has $C P T = +1$.
