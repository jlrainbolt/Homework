\state{Rutherford scattering (Peskin \& Schroeder 4.4)}{
	The cross section for scattering of an electron by the Coulomb field of a nucleus can be computed, to lowest order, without quantizing the electromagnetic field.  Instead, treat the field as a given, classical potential $\Asmx$.  The interaction Hamiltonian is
	\eq{
		\HI = \int \ddcx e \psib \gamm \psi \Asm,
	}
	where $\psix$ is the usual quantized Dirac field.
}

\prob{
	Show that the $T$-matrix element for electron scattering off a localized classical potential is, to lowest order,
	\eq{
		\melppiTp = -i e \ubpp \gamm \up \cdot \tAsm(p' - p),
	}
	where $\tAsmq$ is the four-dimensional Fourier transform of $\Asmx$.
}



%\prob{
%	If $\Asmx$ is time independent, its Fourier transform contains a delta function of energy.  It is then natural to define
%	\eq{
%		\melppiTp \equiv i \cM \cdot (2\pi) \del(\Ef - \Ei),
%	}
%	where $\Ei$ and $\Ef$ are the initial and final energies of the particle, and to adopt a new Feynman rule for computing $\cM$:
%	\eq{
%		\centergraphics{diag/boson} = -i e \gamm \tAsmvq,
%	}
%	where $\tAsmvq$ is the three-dimensional Fourier transform of $\Asmx$.  Given this definition of $\cM$, show that the cross section for scattering off a time-independent, localized potential is
%	\eq{
%		\ddsig = \frac{1}{\vi} \frac{1}{2 \Ei} \ddcpff \frac{1}{2 \Ef} \abs{\cM(\pin \to \pf)}^2 (2\pi) \del(\Ef - \Ei),
%	}
%	where $\vi$ is the particle's initial velocity.  This formula is a natural modification of (4.79).  Integrate over $\abs{\pf}$ to find a simple expression for $\dv*{\sig}{\Omg}$.
%}



%\prob{
%	Specialize to the case of electron scattering from a Coulomb potential ($\Ao = Z e / 4\pi r$).  Working in the nonrelativistic limit, derive the Rutherford formula,
%	\eq{
%		\dv{\sig}{\Omg} = \frac{\alp^2 Z^2}{4 m^2 v^4 \sin[4](\tht / 2)}.
%	}
