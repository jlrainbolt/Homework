\state{Spin-wave theory~(P\&S 11.1)}{\hfix}

\prob{ \label{1a}
	Prove the following wonderful formula: Let $\phix$ be a free scalar field with propagator $\ev{T \phix \phio} = \Dx$.  Then
	\eqn{show1}{
		\ev{ T e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} } = e^{[ \Dx - \Do ]}.
	}
	(The  factor $\Do$ gives a formally divergent adjustment of the overall normalization.)
}

\sol{
	According to P\&S~(9.18),
	\eq{
		\ev*{T \phi(\xq) \phi(\xw)}{\Omg} = \frac{\int \DDphi \phi(\xq) \phi(\xw) \exp[ i \int \ddqx \cL ]}{\int \DDphi \exp[ i \int \ddqx \cL ]}.
	}
	We use this expression to write the left-hand side of Eq.~\refeq{show1}:
	\eqn{thing1}{
		\ev{ T e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} } = \frac{\int \DDphi e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} \exp[ i \int \ddqy \cL ]}{\int \DDphi \exp[ i \int \ddqy \cL ]}
		= \frac{\int \DDphi \exp[i \phix - i \phio + i \int \ddqy \cL ]}{\int \DDphi \exp[ i \int \ddqy \cL ]}.
	}
	For a free Klein-Gordon~(i.e., scalar) field, Eq.~(9.39) tells us that the generating functional $\ZJ$ is given by
	\eq{
		\ZJ = \Zo \exp[ -\frac{1}{2} \int \ddqx \ddqy \Jx \DF(x - y) \Jy ],
	}
	where $\Zo = Z[0]$.  Thus, we want to find some $\Jy$ such that
	\eqn{thing1b}{
		\ev{ T e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} } = \frac{\ZJ}{\Zo}
	}
	where in general
	\eq{
		\ZJ = \int \DDphi \exp[ i \int \ddqx [ \cL + \Jx \phi(x) ] ]
	}
	by (9.34).  Inspecting Eq.~\refeq{thing1}, we recognize the denominator as $\Zo$ and see that if
	\eq{
		\Jy = \delq(y - x) - \delq(y)
	}
	we have an expression like Eq.~\refeq{thing1b}.  Collecting these findings, we have
	\al{
		\ans{ \ev{ T e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} } }&= \frac{\ZJ}{\Zo} \\
		&= \exp[ -\frac{1}{2} \int \ddqy \ddqz \Jy \DF(y - z) \Jz ] \\
		&= \exp[ -\frac{1}{2} \int \ddqy \ddqz \Jy \DF(y - z) [ \delq(z - x) - \delq(z) ] ] \\
		&= \exp[ -\frac{1}{2} \int \ddqy [ \delq(y - x) - \delq(y) ] [ \DF(y - x) - \DF(y) ] ] \\
		&= \exp[ -\frac{1}{2} [ \DF(0) - \DF(x) - \DF(-x) + \DF(0) ] ] \\
		&= \exp[ \DF(x) - \DF(0) ] \\
		&\ans{\; = e^{[ \Dx - \Do ]}, }
	}
	as we wanted to show. \qed
}



\prob{ \label{1b}
	We can use this formula in Euclidean field theory to discuss correlation functions in a theory with spontaneously broken symmetry for $T < \TC$.  Let us consider only the simplest case of a broken $O(2)$ or $U(1)$ symmetry.  We can write the local spin density as a complex variable
	\eq{
		\sx = \sqx + i \swx.
	}
	The global symmetry is the transformation
	\eq{
		\sx \to e^{-i \alp} \sx.
	}
	If we assume that the physics freezes the modulus of $\sx$, we can parameterize
	\eqn{sx}{
		\sx = A e^{i \phix}
	}
	and write an effective Lagrangian for the field $\phix$.  The symmetry of the theory becomes the translation symmetry
	\eqn{symmetry}{
		\phix \to \phix - \alp.
	}
	Show that (for $d > 0$) the most general renormalizable Lagrangian consistent with this symmetry is the free field theory
	\eqn{show1b}{
		\cL = \frac{1}{2} \rho(\vgrad \phi)^2.
	}
	In statistical mechanics, the constant $\rho$ is called the \emph{spin wave modulus}.  A reasonable hypothesis for $\rho$ is that it is finite for $T < \TC$ and tends to 0 as $T \to \TC$ from below.
}

\sol{
	In accordance with the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian in P\&S~(2.6), we interpret $(\vgrad \phi)^2$ as $(\pt \phi)^2$.
	
	The Lagrangian cannot have terms of $\order{\phi^n}$ for any $n \neq 0$ since $\phi(x)$ is not invariant under Eq.~\refeq{symmetry}.  Any combination of derivatives of $\phi$ is invariant, however, since $\alp$ is a constant and does not contribute to any derivative.  Thus, only terms like $\pt^n \phi^m$ (where $n$ denotes a power of $\pt$) for integers $n, m > 0$ and $n \geq m$ are consistent with the symmetry of Eq.~\refeq{symmetry} for $d$ an integer.
	
	Now we must determine which of these terms are renormalizable.  We know that the Lagrangian must have dimension $d$, and that $\phi$ has dimension $(d - 2) / 2$.  Taking a derivative adds a mass dimension.  The theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant $\rho$ has dimension greater than or equal to 0~\cite[p.~322]{Peskin}.  Let $p$ be the dimension of $\rho$, which must be an integer.  The dimension of our allowed term is then
	\eq{
		[ \rho \pt^n \phi^m ] = p + n + m \frac{d - 2}{2},
	}
	which we require to be equal to $d$.  Thus we seek solutions to the system of equations
	\al{
		d &= p + n + m \frac{d - 2}{2}, &
		n &\geq m, &
		p &\geq 0.
	}
	Solving with Mathematica, we find that this system has only one solution, $n = m = 2$ and $p = 0$.  This means that $\rho$ must be dimensionless and the only allowed terms in the Lagrangian are proportional to $\pt^2 \phi^2 = (\pt \phi)^4$, which is consistent with Eq.~\refeq{show1b}. \qed

\prob{
	Compute the correlation function $\ev{ \sx \sao }$.  Adjust $A$ to give a physically sensible normalization (assuming that the system has a physical cutoff at the scale of one atomic spacing) and display the dependence of this correlation function on $x$ for $d = 1, 2, 3, 4$.  Explain the significance of your results.
}

\sol{
	Applying Eq.~\refeq{sx},
	\eq{
		\ev{ \sx \sao } = \ev*{ A e^{i \phix} \As e^{-i \phio} }
		= \ev*{ \abs{A}^2 } \ev*{ e^{i \phix} e^{-i \phio} }.
	}
	Now we can apply Eq.~\refeq{show1} to find
	\eqn{thing1c}{
		\ans{ \ev{ \sx \sao } = \ev*{ \abs{A}^2 } \exp[ D(x) - D(0) ], }
	}
	where $D(x - y)$ is a Green's function.  It is similar to the Green's function of the Klein-Gordon operator, which is given by P\&S~(2.56):
	\eq{
		(\pt^2 + m^2) D(x - y) = -i \delq(x - y).
	}
	The Feynman prescription for this Green's function is given by (2.59),
	\eqn{DF}{
		\DF(x - y) = \int \ddqpf \frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i \eps} e^{i p \cdot (x - y)}.
	}
	For the Lagrangian in Eq.~\refeq{show1b}, we set $m = 0$ and insert a factor of $\rho$:
	\eq{
		\rho \pt^2 D(x - y) = -i \deld(x - y),
	}
	so adapting Eq.~\refeq{DF} for this situation yields
	\eq{
		\DF(x - y) = \frac{1}{\rho} \int \dddpf \frac{i}{p^2 + i \eps} e^{i p \cdot (x - y)}.
	}
	We see that $\DF(0)$ \hl{diverges, so we absorb it into} the normalization to make it physically sensible.  Define $A'$ such that
	\eq{
		{A'}^2 = \ev*{ \abs{A}^2 } e^{-D(0)}.
	}
	Then Eq.~\refeq{thing1c} can be written
	\eq{
		\ev{ \sx \sao } = {A'}^2 D(x).
	}
	By analogy with P\&S~(9.48), after Wick rotation the Green's function is
	\eq{
		\DF(\xE - \yE) = \int \dddkf \frac{e^{i \kE \cdot (\xE - \yE)}}{\kE^2}
	}
	\hl{how to evaluate this integral???}

\state{The Gross-Neveu model~(P\&S 11.3)}{
	The Gross-Neveu model is a model in two spacetime dimensions of fermions with a discrete chiral symmetry:
	\eqn{given2}{
		\cL = \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psibsi \psisi)^2
	}
	with $i = 1, \ldots, N$.  The kinetic term of two-dimensional fermions is built from matrices $\gamm$ that satisfy the two-dimensional Dirac algebra.  These matrices can be $2 \times 2$:
	\al{
		\gamo &= \sigw, &
		\gamq &= i \sigq,
	}
	where $\sigi$ are Pauli sigma matrices.  Define
	\eq{
		\gamt = \gamo \gamq = \sige;
	}
	this matrix anticommutes with the $\gamm$.
}

\prob{ \label{2a}
	Show that this theory is invariant with respect to
	\eqn{trans}{
		\psisi \to \gamt \psisi,
	}
	and that this symmetry forbids the appearance of a fermion mass.
}

\sol{
	Under this transformation, the Lagrangian Eq.~\refeq{given2} is unchanged:
	\al{
		\cL &= i \psidsi \gamo \gamm \ptsm \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psidsi \gamo \psisi)^2 \\
		&\to i \psidsi \gamt \gamo \gamm \ptsm \gamt \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psidsi \gamt \gamo \gamt \psisi)^2 \\
		&= -i \psidsi \gamt \gamo \gamt \gamm \ptsm \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (-\psidsi \gamo \psisi)^2 \\
		&= i \psidsi \gamo \gamm \ptsm \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psidsi \gamo \psisi)^2 \\
		&= \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psibsi \psisi)^2.
	}
	Here we have used $\ptsl = \gamm \ptsm$~\cite[p.~49]{Peskin}, $\psib = \psid \gamo$ by P\&S~(3.32), and (3.69)--(3.71):
	\al{
		(\gamt)^\dag &= \gamt, &
		(\gamt)^2 &= 1, &
		\{ \gamt, \gamm \} &= 0,
	}
	which also hold for the 2-dimensional Dirac algebra.  Thus we have shown that the theory is invariant with respect to the transformation in Eq.~\refeq{trans} because it does not change the Lagrangian. \qed
	
	If the theory had a mass, the first term would take the form of the Dirac Lagrangian in (3.34):
	\eq{
		\cLDirac = \psibsi (i \ptsl - m) \psisi.
	}
	However, this term is not invariant under Eq.~\refeq{trans}:
	\al{
		\cLDirac &= i \psidsi \gamo \gamm \ptsm \psisi - m \psidsi \gamo \psisi \\
		&\to i \psidsi \gamt \gamo \gamm \ptsm \gamt \psisi - m \psidsi \gamt \gamo \gamt \psisi \\
		&= i \psidsi \gamo \gamm \ptsm \psisi + m \psidsi \gamo \psisi \\
		&= \psibsi (i \ptsl + m) \psisi.
	}
	Since the sign of the mass term changes under the transformation, a nonzero fermion mass $m$ is forbidden. \qed
}



\prob{
	Show that this theory is renormalizable in 2 dimensions (at the level of dimensional analysis).
}

\sol{
	We need to find the dimension of the coupling constant $g$.  As in \ref{1b}, the Lagrangian must have dimension $d = 2$.  The $\gamm$ are dimensionless, and $\pt$ adds one mass dimension.  We can find the dimension of $\psisi$ by requiring that the dimension of the first term of Eq.~\refeq{given2} is 2.  Let $[ \psisi ] = n$.  Then
	\eq{
		2 = [ \psibsi \ptsl \psisi ]
		= n + 1 + n
		\qimplies
		n = \frac{1}{2}.
	}
	We may now use this result in the second term to find the dimension of $g$.  Let $[ g ] = m$.  Then
	\eq{
		2 = [ g^2 (\psibsi \psisi)^2 ]
		= 2m + 2 (n + n)
		= 2 (m + 1)
		\qimplies
		m = 0,
	}
	meaning $g$ is dimensionless.  Therefore the theory is indeed renormalizable~\cite[p.~322]{Peskin}. \qed
}



\prob{
	Show that the functional integral for this theory can be represented in the following form:
	\eqn{show2c}{
		\int \DDpsi e^{i \int \ddsx \cL} = \int \DDpsi \DDsig \exp[ i \int \ddsx \curly{ \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi - \sig \psibsi \psisi - \frac{1}{2 g^2} \sig^2 } ],
	}
	where $\sigx$ (not to be confused with a Pauli matrix) is a new scalar field with no kinetic energy terms.
}

\sol{
	Completing the square in the exponent of the right-hand side of Eq.~\refeq{show2c} yields
	\eq{
		\int \DDpsi \DDsig \exp[ i \int \ddsx \curly{ -\frac{1}{2 g^2} (\sig + g^2 \psibsi \psisi)^2 + \frac{g^2}{2} (\psibsi \psisi)^2 + \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi } ].
	}
	Pulling out the integral over $\sig$, note that
	\eqn{integral}{
		\int \DDsig \exp[ -i \int \ddsx \frac{1}{2 g^2} (\sig + g^2 \psibsi \psisi)^2 ] \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \det(g^2)}} = \const.
	}
	This is obtained from P\&S~(9.24),
	\eq{
		\paren{ \prodk \int \ddxisk } \exp[ -\xisi \Bsij \xisj ] = \const \times [ \det B ]^{-1/2},
	}
	where in Eq.~\refeq{integral} we obtain an expression like this if we transform variables to $u = \sig + g^2 \psibsi \psisi$.  At any rate, the result is that we obtain
	\al{
		\int \DDpsi \DDsig \exp[ i \int \ddsx \curly{ \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi - \sig \psibsi \psisi - \frac{1}{2 g^2} \sig^2 } ]
		&= \const \times \int \DDpsi \exp[ i \int \ddsx \curly{ \frac{g^2}{2} (\psibsi \psisi)^2 + \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi } ] \\
		&= \const \times \int \DDpsi e^{i \int \ddsx \cL}
	}
	where $\cL$ is given by Eq.~\refeq{given2}.  The overall constant factor between the two expressions is not important \hl{for some reason}, so we have proven Eq.~\refeq{show2c}. \qed
}



\prob{
	Compute the leading correction to the effective potential for $\sig$ by integrating over the fermion fields $\psisi$.  You will encounter the determinant of a Dirac operator; to evaluate this determinant, diagonalize the operator by first going to Fourier components and then diagonalizing the $2 \times 2$ Pauli matrix associated with each Fourier mode.  (Alternatively, you might just take the determinant of this $2 \times 2$ matrix.)   This 1-loop contribution requires a renormalization proportional to $\sigw$ (that is, a renormalization of $g^2$).  Renormalize by minimal subtraction.
}



\prob{ \label{2e}
	Ignoring two-loop and higher-order contributions, minimize this potential.  Show that the $\sig$ field acquires a vacuum expectation value which breaks the symmetry of \ref{2a}.  Convince yourself that this result does not depend on the particular renormalization condition chosen.
}



\prob{
	Note that the effective potential derived in \ref{2e} depends on $g$ and $N$ according to the form
	\eq{
		\Veff(\sigcl) = N \cdot f(g^2 N).
	}
	(The overall factor of $N$ is expected in a theory with $N$ fields.)  Construct a few of the higher-order contributions to the effective potential and show that they contain additional factors of $N^{-1}$ which suppress them if we take the limit $N \to \infty$, ($g^2 N$) fixed.  In this limit, the result of \ref{2e} is unambiguous.
