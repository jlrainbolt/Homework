\state{}{
	Consider the path integral for a single point particle, with the action
	\eq{
		S = \intoq \ddt \brac{ \psmt \xdmt + \frac{\Nt}{2} [ \pst - m^2 - i \eps ] }.
	}
	This represents the quantization of the coordinates and momenta of the particle, subject to the mass shell constraint $p^2 = m^2$ (together with the $i \eps$ prescription) imposed by the Lagrange multiplier $N$.  This action admits the reparametrization symmetry $\del x = \alp p$, $\del p = 0$, $\del N = -\ptst \alp$ where $\alpt$ is any function.  This symmetry allows us to fix the gauge condition $\Nt = T$; the constant $T$ must still be integrated over, however.
}

\prob{
	Path integrate over $\xt$, subject to the boundary conditions $\xm(0) = \xm$, $\xm(1) = \ym$, yielding a delta function $\delpd$ along the path.  Solve this constraint (find the set of functions that solve it) and path integrate over those $\ptt$ to find the quantum mechanical propagation amplitude
	\eq{
		\bkyx = \DF(x - y)
		= \intoi \ddT (2 \pi i T)^{d / 2} \exp[ -\frac{i}{2} \paren{ (m^2 - i \eps) T + \frac{(x - y)^2}{T} } ],
	}
	where $d$ is the number of spacetime dimensions.
}



\prob{
	Use this integral representation to show that $\DF$ satisfies
	\eq{
		(\del^2 + m^2) \DF = i \deld(x - y).
	}
}



\prob{
	Evaluate the $T$ integral in terms of Bessel functions.

\state{Quantum statistical mechanics (Peskin \& Schroeder 9.2)}{\hfix}

\prob{
	Evaluate the quantum statistical partition function
	\eq{
		Z = \Tr(e^{-\bet H})
	}
	(where $\bet = 1 / k T$) using the strategy of Section~9.1 for evaluating the matrix elements of $e^{-i H t}$ in terms of functional integrals.  Show that one again finds a functional integral, over functions defined on a domain that is of length $\bet$ and periodically connected in the time direction.  Note that the Euclidean form of the Lagrangian appears in the weight.
}



\prob{
	Evaluate this integral for a simple harmonic oscillator,
	\eq{
		\LE = \frac{1}{2} \xd^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omg^2 x^2,
	}
	by introducing a Fourier decomposition of $\xt$:
	\eq{
		\xt = \sumn \xn \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bet}} e^{2 \pi i n t / \bet}.
	}
	The dependence of the result on $\bet$ is a bit subtle to obtain explicitly, since the measure for the integral over $\xt$ depends on $\bet$ in any discretization.  However, the dependence on $\omg$ should be unambiguous.  Show that, up to a (possibly divergent and $\bet$-dependent) constant, the integral reproduces exactly the familiar expression for the quantum partition function of an oscillator.  [You may find the identity
	\eq{
		\sinh z = z \prodnqi \paren{ 1 + \frac{z^2}{(n \pi)^2} }
	}
	useful.]
}



\prob{
	Generalize this construction to field theory.  Show that the quantum statistical partition function for a free scalar field can be written in terms of a functional integral.  The value of this integral is given formally by
	\eq{
		[ \det(-\pt^2 + m^2) ]^{-1 / 2},
	}
	where the operator acts on functions on Euclidean space that are periodic in the time direction with periodicity $\bet$.  As before, the $\bet$ dependence of this expression is difficult to compute directly.  However, the dependence on $m^2$ is unambiguous.  Show that the determinant indeed reproduces the partition function for relativistic scalar particles.
