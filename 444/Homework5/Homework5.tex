\state{Beta functions in Yukawa theory~(P\&S 12.1)}{
	In the pseudoscalar Yukawa theory studied in Problem~10.2, with masses set to zero,
	\eq{
		\cL = \frac{1}{2} (\ptsm \phi)^2 - \frac{\lam}{4!} \phi^4 + \psib (i \ptsl) \psi - i g \psib \gamt \psi \phi,
	}
	compute the Callan-Symanzik $\bet$ functions for $\lam$ and $g$:
	\al{
		&\betsl(\lam, g), &
		&\betsg(\lam, g),
	}
	to leading order in coupling constants, assuming that $\lam$ and $g^2$ are of the same order.  Sketch the coupling constant flows in the $\lam$-$g$ plane.

\state{Beta function of the Gross-Neveu model~(P\&S~12.2)}{
	Compute $\bet(g)$ in the two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model studied in Problem~11.3,
	\eq{
		\cL = \psibsi i \ptsl \psisi + \frac{1}{2} g^2 (\psibsi \psisi)^2,
	}
	with $i = 1, \ldots, N$.  You should find that this model is asymptotically free.  How was that fact reflected in the solution to Problem~11.3?
